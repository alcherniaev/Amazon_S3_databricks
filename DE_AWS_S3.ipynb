The location of the apartment is so lovely.  Not only are you in what many people feel is the best part of Stockholm (Södermalm) but her flat is situated in an area with lots of green space.  So, the views from your windows, and the overall vibe, make it feel very tranquil.  The apartment itself is so well decorated and I found that I looked forward to spending time there at the end of each day.  The shower is amazing.  The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.  It was very clear that she put much effort into getting the flat ready, making it spotless, and other little thoughtful details.

When my boyfriend and I were heading to downtown Stockholm, we would use the city rental bikes and there is a stand very close to Lovisa's apartment. It's about a 20 minute cycle to the central train station and Stockholm bike lanes are well done. The actual apartment was very clean, great design and absolutely ideal for a couple.

On the other hand all places were reached easily by foot or by metro or bus and there are all facilities you might need (e.g. supermarkets, restaurants) close to the flat. It's a very cosy and really tidy flat. Lovisa arranged some space at her wardrobe and her shoes commode for my private stuff so I felt like at home. I met Lovisa once, she welcomed me warmly and answered quickly all questions I had during that week and asked occasionally if everything is okay. Further I find her guide book very helpful. Thanks again, Lovisa, for your perfect hospitality! "],["164448","472271","2011-08-24","894674","Liliana","Lidia is a very nice person. Very good plase to stay for visit Stockolm.

Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.\n\nThe following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.\nThe address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.\n\nShe uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.\n\nShe does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.\n\nHer TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.\n\nShe has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room\n\nThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.\n\nLi will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked.

Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. \n\nSödermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.\n\nNeed somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.\n\nI can't thank her enough.

The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.

When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!\nIt is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space.

There were three guest teams altogether but we had no difficulty using the bathroom. We had a lot of conversation with Lidia and the other guest, a German lady, sharing cultures and experiences. The most fascinating point with Lidia was that she pinpointed some really nice tourists' attractions in Stockholm, which was quite helpful for us to visit super worthy places. We recommend Lidia's house with both our thumbs up! We will also definitely stay at her house on our next visit to Stockholm for one to two weeks. Our stay at Lidia's house was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. Thank you for everything, Lidia.

The place is a few minutes walk from parks, public swimming areas, attractive neighborhoods, a spectacular statue of Thor slaying a vicious sea serpent named Jörmungandr, and a walking path along a cliff that gives you the best views of the city at night.

Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.\n\nThe following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.\nThe address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.\n\nShe uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.\n\nShe does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.\n\nHer TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.\n\nShe has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room\n\nThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.\n\nLi will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in.</td></tr><tr><td>164448</td><td>289792128</td><td>2018-07-13</td><td>13541212</td><td>Thodoris</td><td>The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places.

We enjoyed the common area, fridge, and microwave that she makes available to her guests - perfect for staying in on a rainy day. As you are in the upper floor of the flat, it can get a little stuffy when the weather is hot (as it was while we were there). Probably not an issue other times of the year or in cooler summers. \n\nWe found the location very convenient - about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan - but we also loved exploring Södermalm, which is a great neighborhood, with great dining options within a 5-10 min walk.

Li is a great, hospitable host, with excellent knowledge of the city and always happy to share tips and suggestions. In her apartment there are a few different rooms for guests, but it’s really nice and quiet at all times as everyone respects the common space. There is a pleasant sitting area for guests on a separate floor, with microwave, fridge, cutlery/cups etc. for guests. Generally, anything you might need is available - toiletries, hairdryers, ironing facilities etc. There is no full kitchen available, but we - and most guests probably - didn’t find it problematic as there is the microwave and lots of cheap places to get food/eat out around. The room we had was very warm (there’s a fan available too!), clean and decorated in a quaint, old-fashioned style with lots of books; plenty of storage space too.

The apartment is an oasis of bright, light calm and wonderfully located in vibrant Hornstull, just round the corner from the Tunnelbanna (although why anyone would take public transport in a city so lovely to walk around beats me). Five star stay in every way- the only downside was having to come back to London... Go to Stockholm, stay at Marie's, just don't you dare try to book the same days as me (I'll definitely be coming back)! Thank you so much again, Marie.

There is no seating, however - which was an issue when making a sit-down meal. The patio/balcony was a great place to sit and enjoy the sun! Very easy to communicate with Marie. Wifi was great (except we accidentally unplugged the router thing, and it eventually ran out of battery and we struggled to figure out how to get internet back!) The room does not have dark curtains; hopefully not an issue for others. Bathroom was a little tight, but doable - no shower curtain, which was odd. I would recommend this place to anyone!

The room was very spacious, sunny and clean, classily decorated with Elizabeth’s taste, with a very nice view of Katarina Bangata STR.

It is a 10 minute walk from Gamla Stan and a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre.\r\n\r\nThe room and bathroom were spacious and is suitable for up to 2 guests. Elisabeth also provided a very nice breakfast. Although the facilities were shared, Elisabeth was very discrete and respected privacy. This place does not have wifi. However, this was not too much of an issue because of the short walking distances around Stockholm. Elisabeth was kind enough to research information about getting around Stockholm, weather etc on our behalf when requested.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend Elisabeth's room for one or two travellers.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>2176688</td><td>2012-09-03</td><td>2452548</td><td>Marko</td><td>Elisabeth is a very charming host whose amiability added a very important and enjoyable dimension to our experience of Stockholm and Sweden.

And although she is living in that flat too, we had a spare key and so were free to go come and go whenever we wanted. And sure the breakfast we had every morning was nicer than buying a pair of rolls every single day.\r\nAll in all it was a nice stay, much better than any hostels or low price hotels you can find for the same price. Only one thing we regret, there were two single beds in our romm with no possibility to put them side by side.\r\nThat being said, we recommend this facility if you're about to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm, capital of Sweden.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>2830063</td><td>2012-11-07</td><td>3516430</td><td>Teresa</td><td>Really great experience staying with Elisabeth.

There's one bathroom with a bath and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose, but it's also spacious and there was never a problem sharing.  The T-bana (Metro) is nearby (0.6 km) but we enjoyed the pretty walk to the Royal Palace (2.2 km) and downtown (2.8 km) areas.  It's an expensive city so check out the lunch specials during the work week and invest in the Stockholm Pass if you like museums (there are many good ones) and boat trips.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>156762993</td><td>2017-06-01</td><td>116007954</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Elizabeth is a very nice to us and we fell very comfortable during the stay.

Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. \n\nSödermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.\n\nNeed somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.\n\nI can't thank her enough. Even a week was not enough in the most beautiful Scandinavian city. \n\nAnd finally, did I mention you should book this place? :-)</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>194281231</td><td>2017-09-16</td><td>142374402</td><td>Bryce</td><td>I booked accommodation for my mother and her friend with Elisabeth.

She continued to be a happy and fun host for the duration of our week-long stay. The breakfast each morning was fabulous and if we behaved ourselves we were treated with a chocolate =). \n\nThe location was perfect. Right in the middle of Sodermalm, yet down a quiet and very safe feeling street. The train station was only a short walk through the heart of the city.\n\nThe room was spacious and comfortable with towels and linen provided.\n\nThank you very much Elisabeth for making us feel so welcome in your home and city. You made our experience much more fun than staying elsewhere. \n\nBe sure to comment on the light shade in the kitchen during your stay with Elisabeth and watch her face light up!\n\nWe can not recommend Elisabeth and her AirBnB highly enough.\n\nMany thanks,\nLinda and Sue</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>205949551</td><td>2017-10-23</td><td>44602255</td><td>Victor</td><td>We felt like at our home!

As Fredric and I had different work schedules, we often only met briefly. Our interaction was always enjoyable, and Fredric created a great balance between allowing for personal space and offering a sociable atmosphere. Fredric helped me with all of my questions about how to do things in Sweden. I would be happy to stay there again anytime.</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>45186449</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>31909872</td><td>Saskia</td><td>I had a wonderful time in this apartment.

There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>75565359</td><td>2016-05-22</td><td>67850073</td><td>Chengkai</td><td>Fredric is a really nice people and helps me a lot!</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>76399525</td><td>2016-05-27</td><td>71660399</td><td>Hassan</td><td>All I can say is that Fredric was a great host.

Despite being in the middle of everything the apartment is as quiet as being out in the woods; you will sleep very soundly! Mia is a very helpful and knowledgeable host and was full of tips and good advice. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated in whites and blues. The internet speed was plenty to support 2 simultaneous (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at great quality.

It is in a charming building from 1899. Despite being in a vibrant quarter of Stockholm, it is very quiet and peaceful. \r\n\r\nThe metro (tunnelbana) stop is just two minutes away or you can walk to the city centre, which takes around 15 minutes. There are a couple of super-markets close by in case you are spending several days and want to cook for yourselves. \r\n\r\nIf you want to eat out, there is plenty of choice. Try the newly opened Kin Maru restaurant just round their corner. Their vegetarian bibimbap is very good. \r\n\r\nAh and if you are fan of Pippi Longstocking, then you are in for a treat because the house where Astrid Lindgren lived for 60 years is just around the corner. \r\n\r\nWe plan to stay here the next time we visit Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>4056037</td><td>2013-04-06</td><td>4816447</td><td>Suzannah</td><td>Mia is a fantastic host!

Her apartment was clean, had excellent access to public transport, and most importantly was a great central location to downtown Stockholm.  I found that people like to walk in that city, and the location was great for that as well.  The bus from the airport stops just a block away from her place, there is a grocery store within a few hundred yards, and a beautiful park just across the street.  She was timely in returning my emails before the trip and very easy to work with.  I highly recommend using Mia's apartment for anyone spending any time in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>4694432</td><td>2013-05-20</td><td>446826</td><td>Kaizar</td><td>Mia was a fantastic.

She gave me advice on what was best to see and do in my downtime (including leaving a bunch of information for me), gave me step by step instructions on how to find her place from the airport and then when I got there took me on a walk around to familiarise myself with the neighbourhood. Her apartment is a little gem and is so close to everything that you could need.

Vasaparken, with its ice-skating rink, is just across the street, so if you have your own skates you can nip over for a bit of skating before or after your day's activities.  The Hagaparken, with its walking paths, is also quite close.  The apartment faces the courtyard, not the street, so it is very quiet.  It is also very well heated.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was well equipped, the sofa in the living room is very comfortable, and the apartment was very clean and nicer than the pictures.  Mia was very friendly, greeted us exactly as arranged, and gave us a short tour of the neighborhood.  She has a collection of guidebooks and maps of the city in the apartment, and she provided two Access cards for public transport (Stockholm's equivalent of Oyster cards) for our use, which was very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe bed is very soft, which is great for some people and uncomfortable for others.  I can recommend Mia and her apartment highly.\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>11833618</td><td>2014-04-16</td><td>12460346</td><td>Julius</td><td>Mia was an excellent host.

It was a pleasure to stay and if I was visiting Stockholm again I would certainly consider contacting Mia to see if her place was available.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was relaxing and centrally located, very nice to walk around with a big leafy park very near.

Getting a travelcard is the best way to see the city. Mia met with us on the night before our departure. She is an intelligent, delightful person who takes pride in being a host. If she is in Stockholm to greet her guests, I am sure that she can give them terrific insights regarding her city.

Would highly recommend getting to meet her if you stay at her place!\r\nThe area is very nice surrounded by many restaurants and a beautiful park.

We loved our stay in her apartment-- good location, and easy to walk to from the central station, if you like walking. We never used public transportation during our stay, and were delighted by the availability of coffee shops, grocery stores, and antique stores in the area. The apartment itself is in a very secure building, with a well-stocked kitchen for basic cooking, and the extra bed is actually extremely comfortable, even though it's a fold-up one! Mia left us hot chocolate when the weather turned cold, was kind enough to help me by actually taking care of my laundry for me, and was extremely understanding when we had to arrive a day late, even though she didn't get our message in time.

While Mia wasn't in town during my and my friend's stay, she did an amazing job of staying in touch, coordinating, and providing helpful tips throughout our visit. She's incredibly thoughtful and responsive. Not to mention that the apartment is perfect for two travelers and is nice and quiet, as it is set back from the street. It is a very well-appointed apartment and has a good, functional kitchen if you've had a long (and maybe cold) day of touring around and would prefer a warm, relaxed night in cooking your own dinner. Vasastan is a vibrant neighborhood with many restaurants, coffeehouse, and bar options, though the apartment is convenient for those interested in Gamla Stan or Soldermalm too, given that the quick and efficient subway system is just a few steps away. Stockholm is a lovely city and this is the perfect apartment from which to explore it!</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>917789</td><td>2012-02-13</td><td>1612490</td><td>Mike</td><td>Lovely host and ideal location for Sodermalm as well as getting to the exhibition centre where I was working.

I tend to stay to myself and this is a real change for me to stay in someones home. I have been in Sweden for over a month and I have never had a better sleep than what I had at Lidias.  She cannot seem to do enough for you. I have already passed her name along to a colleage of mine who frequently has people coming to Sweden on business.

Lidia is extremely welcoming, and keen for you to have the best experience of this wonderful city.

Her home is located in a fairly central neighbourhood, a 5-10 minute easy walk from the metro and commuter trains. The area is bustling in the evenings, with lots of restaurants and bars.  The old town is a 15 minute walk away. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.  I got back very late each night and that's not a problem as long as you are respectful of the other guests and don't make any noise. Walking back late at night was also completely safe. There are 3-4 rooms located off the first floor landing, including a bathroom which everyone shares and which is very clean. There are shared tea/coffee making facilities and Lidia was very accommodating in providing me with the use of an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast is very generous.

Lidia is an excellent host: super friendly, very keen on making sure her guests feel instantly at home...somehow there always seems to have a cup of coffee or tea ready :) So thanks for the great time, I do plan to be back and I recommend very much to anybody intending to travel to STO to see if there's a room available at Lidia's.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>11951549</td><td>2014-04-20</td><td>11624311</td><td>Michael</td><td>Lidia was an excellent host.

The description was accurate. I stayed in the single room. It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!  </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>34472972</td><td>2015-06-08</td><td>29483133</td><td>Leonard</td><td>Lidia has been an extremely wonderful host.

She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  \r\n\r\nThe room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   \r\n\r\nThere were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  \r\n\r\nIt is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.\r\n\r\nLidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter).  </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>45599868</td><td>2015-09-04</td><td>19005461</td><td>Karandeep (KD)</td><td>I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.\r\n\r\nGiven another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>46618008</td><td>2015-09-12</td><td>17613139</td><td>Michael</td><td>Lidia hat mir eine sehr detaillierte Beschreibung geschickt wie ich zu Ihr komme. Die Lage ist wunderbar zentral und alles ist gut zu erreichen. Zum Flughafen kann man direkt durchfahren. Sie war sehr flexibel was die Schlüsselübergabe anging.

I took an overnight flight to Stockholm & Lidia was kind enough to let me in to drop off my luggage in the morning, which was wonderful.  The SL train stop near her place is on the same line as Arlanda airport, which made it very easy to get to & her directions from the train stop to the apartment made the place very easy to find.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>47311337</td><td>2015-09-17</td><td>22175879</td><td>Andrew</td><td>I don't have enough space to leave an adequate  review for Lidia and her place. To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>47470360</td><td>2015-09-19</td><td>37853399</td><td>Martin</td><td>Ett varmt välkomnande. Visade runt på ett mycket bra sätt.

It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.\r\n\r\nThe room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue. \r\n\r\nLidia was very helpful with maps and suggestions of things to do, and tips about public transit. </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>49598434</td><td>2015-10-05</td><td>37869951</td><td>Melanie</td><td>I felt very welcome when I arrive at Lidia's.

She gave me a lot of information and good suggestions how to come around in Stockholm. As my cable for to charge my mobil phone didn´t work she borrowed me her cable for the time I stayed there. So I was able to take the photos and keep in contact with my family and friends. I was even able to practise my swedish with her. She was really a patient person to listen to me and to talk swedish with me even if I did not speak it so well. She had during my visit also some other guests staying there and they were also very nice. I enjoeyd the conversation with Lidia and her guests. It was so nice to stay in her flat,  I feld like home!

There is one single room and 2 double rooms. There is one bathroom for all three rooms. There are locks on all the doors and a common area equipped with a mini-fridge, hot water heater, eating utensils and a microwave. Great wifi and quite clean.   Had no problem with the other guests and with sharing a bathroom. Great experience. \n\nRoom: cozy and cute. I didn't spend much time there so the size of the room did not bother me at all. Lidia was great and made sure the trash was emptied every day. I had enough towels, a water glass and she even made my bed. :). There is a desk in the room with 2 lamps along with an overhead lamp. The room faces a playground area/park so sometimes you will hear kids playing soccer but it was not a problem for me. It does get plenty of light (I actually had sunshine during my trip to Stockholm) so it made me wish I had brought my eye mask.  \n\nLocation: Great location. Public transportation (T-bana & bus stops) around the corner. Near yummy bakeries and delicious coffee houses. I had an early morning cruise on the Viking Line. It was an easy 30-min walk to their harbor. She lives on the 5th floor of her building but there is a great elevator. \n\nLidia is a great host and she wants to be a resource to her guests. She gave me great directions to her apartment from Arlanda. Once I arrived, we had coffee and she talked to me about Stockholm and all that it has to offer. She was very kind and you can tell she enjoy hosting us tourists. It was nice to come home to a friendly face -- she even remembered some of my random Stockholm travel plans!  Thank you, Lidia. </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>97096905</td><td>2016-08-25</td><td>24741850</td><td>Diana</td><td>Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.\r\n\r\nMy parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.\r\n\r\nMy single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.\r\n\r\nI really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.\r\n\r\nLidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>98021560</td><td>2016-08-29</td><td>76850236</td><td>Haruka</td><td>Her hospitality was perfect!!\r\nShe was always kind for me:)\r\nAnd she told me how to go the sightseeing sight or some Swedish words!

Yo realicé la mayoría de trayectos hacia la ciudad andando, y era febrero y había nieve, es decir, el alojamiento está suficientemente cerca para ir dando un agradable paseo hasta el centro de Estocolmo. \nLí es una excelente anfitriona, atenta, rápida en responder, deseosa de ayudar y de orientar con buenas informaciones sobre la ciudad. \nMi habitación no era muy grande, pero era luminosa, estaba limpia y bien dotada en lo esencial.  La habitación está en la parte de arriba del piso (es tipo duplex) y fuera de la habitación hay un salón-zona común con sofás, neveras, microondas.. etc.. que te dá un espacio agradable para otros usos antes de irte a dormir.  \nCreo que en conjunto es un lugar muy recomendable como opción para alojarse.  \nGracias Lí!!</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>236433101</td><td>2018-02-19</td><td>94190128</td><td>Jillian</td><td>The stay at Li's was very pleasant.

The bathroom was very clean and great pressure in the shower, always nice to warm up after a long day exploring. Li was fantastic as a host and gave great tips for traveling around and what to see. Check in was a breeze, my flight got in at midnight, as it was delayed. Li was so kind and stayed up until 2 am giving me helpful directions from the airport to her place and getting me settled into her apartment. She went above and beyond that night and I felt so safe knowing that in a foreign city she was there to help me even though I arrived so late. She also let me leave my bags at her place on the final day (I had a night flight) so I could finish my time in Stockholm without having to drag around my luggage.

Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. \nIn de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. \nLi antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.

Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.\r\nThe room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. \r\nI don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work.</td></tr><tr><td>259722</td><td>1600824</td><td>2012-07-01</td><td>2124234</td><td>Romain</td><td>Marcelo is the best hote of the world !\r\nVery simpatic polite and available.\r\ni have enjoy my travel of 2 months in marcelo's house !\r\nYou can choose marcelo without problems !\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>259722</td><td>2069730</td><td>2012-08-22</td><td>3247493</td><td>Jc</td><td>I enjoyed my stay at Marcelo's apartment..

The room was spacious and comfortable. I would clarify that the 16 minutes to the city center refers only to the time on the train. You have to walk 5 minutes to the station and if you miss a train, as I did, you may have to wait about 10 minutes for the next. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4127917</td><td>2013-04-12</td><td>2404401</td><td>Nele</td><td>I stayed three nights here and I really enjoyed!\r\nIt's a bit far from the city centre, so that may be a little bit inconvenient, but on the other hand: It's very quiet here and it's just five minutes walk to the underground and a supermarket.\r\nI only met Linnéa briefly, but she seems to be a very nice person. I also had the opportunity to meet her two nice Italian friends!\r\nAnd oh yes...the room is spacious and clean - so, just perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4252803</td><td>2013-04-22</td><td>5450665</td><td>Sarah</td><td>Linnea was an excellent host - we stayed with her for 3 nights during the first part of our trip in Sweden. Both Linnea and her house mates were very friendly and welcoming and the house was a calm and wholesome place to be. Lake and woodland very close by as well as direct transport links to the buzzing city centre. Linnea kept in frequent contact prior to our trip which enabled us to find the house very easily. We'd definitely recommend her!</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4440756</td><td>2013-05-05</td><td>6167897</td><td>Emilio</td><td>The stay over att Linne was awsome, she was a nice host and easy going as well.

The house is big, my room was big and confortable too and the flat just reminded me of my times at university: the (Hidden by Airbnb) are young and handsome. And yes it's true, the house is near a wood and a lake and most of all is very easy to reach because is just three minutes walking from the last stop of the line 18 of the underground. I coudn't ask for more. As about Linnea, she's just nice and pretty, quite a sweet host. I recommend this choice.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>7255148</td><td>2013-09-13</td><td>8263257</td><td>David</td><td>I liked the big room with hangers for the clothes, the place is very quiet and clean.

But that is not as important as many would think (though it clearly is an added plus!); what matters is that the place is a haven of friendliness and of calm energy. I had a string of extremely busy days in Stockholm during my booking, but always knew that the stress and pressure would go away as soon as I entered the flat and enjoyed some tea at the kitchen area or talked a bit with Linnea’s lovely family - big and small – that resided in one of the other rooms. The topics varied from the merits of fivefinger running shoes to barista ordering techniques, Swedish school curricula, Albanian dialects, welfare state reform, philosophy and life in Sweden in general… All in all, a positive experience at a place and with people that I could not recommend enough! </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>35243089</td><td>2015-06-16</td><td>33629285</td><td>Susanne</td><td>\"Die immerhin 10 Tage, die ich bei Linnéa verbracht habe, waren für mich eine wunderbare Zeit. Linnéa und ihr Zuhause hatten daran großen Anteil. \r\nAusgewählt habe ich diese Unterkunft ursprünglich aufgrund der Beschreibung  \"\"Nature stay\"\". Und es stimmt.

She was very kind and her house was as described in her listing. It was a good location for exploring the city of Stockholm and the surrounding areas.  I slept very well there.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>65726809</td><td>2016-03-16</td><td>9671505</td><td>Goo</td><td>Nice young family with cute baby!  The house is situated away from the city as the listing says, but it is quite easy to go back and forth from the city, takes literally 30mins including the walk from metro/train. Linnéa lent me the spare transport card so i could top up with the 24 hours pass and that was convenient.\n\nThe walk up is easy but if you are arriving with a big luggage like me in winter time, be prepared for some pushing and rolling.\n\nI didnt see much of Linnéa as she was away with baby, but her bf Arnando took good care of me and even bought breakfast items for me. They even recommended coffee spots for me as i am a coffee hunter, and all the suggestions were great!\n\nHouse and room is big and surely enough space for two people. The trail literally behind the house around the lake is amazing and so is the nature area on the other side of the lake. Went for a nice walk and took me half an hour to get to the other side.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>66302511</td><td>2016-03-20</td><td>2487043</td><td>David</td><td>Linnéa was a fantastic host. I was staying for a few days with the intention of cramming in as much of Stockholm as I could. The apartment is in a great location. It's a really short work to the Metro as well as the beautiful lake (which was covered in a layer of snow on the first day of Spring!). The bed looked comfy and I can attest that it's even better than it looks. Towels and basic toiletries were a nice touch, though I didn't partake it was greatly appreciated and I imagine will be invaluable to those travelling light. She was also kind enough to offer breakfast (which I foolishly didn't realise and didn't make very much use of). Though I didn't see much of my hosts, they were kind and gracious to my comings and goings. Definitely beats a boring hotel! I just wish I could have stayed longer and chatted more.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>69064941</td><td>2016-04-09</td><td>10174350</td><td>Rónán</td><td>The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival.

The apartment is a good size and within about a 7 minute walk to the metro station. It takes about an hour to get into the main city of Stockholm (but there were train upgrades happening which made it a little slower). Linnea purchased some breakfast food for me to prepare in the mornings which was a nice perk. I would stay here again if visiting Stockholm another time. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>310316578</td><td>2018-08-19</td><td>203816250</td><td>Kamil</td><td>Women was very helpful and optimistyc too gest. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>326976972</td><td>2018-09-23</td><td>211500865</td><td>Miranda</td><td>Had an incredible time at Linnéa. It´s close to everything you could ask for: close to nature, close to shoping & close to the green subway line, connecting Farsta to the rest of Stockholm. But the biggest highlight was the host herself. Kind & considerate, she made sure I felt at home the moment I stepped through the door. Overall: 10/10, would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>330254072</td><td>2018-09-30</td><td>13573376</td><td>Fathima</td><td>Mycket nöjd med lägenheten i sig och med kommunikationen.

Honestly the area is (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a daily thriving colourful fruit and veg market encompassed by one big mall. You could easily lose yourself for half a day. It also has great transport links whether you want to head in town or out of town. The other side of Farsta boasts a beautiful park that sits on the edge of a huge lake. The cafe sells mouthwatering cakes. But the piece d resistance has to be the family we stayed with who were top notch hosts that were extremely helpful  with directions and places to see. You felt more like you were doing a homestay rather than Airbnb. Linnea lives in a lovely area and we would certainly come back for more</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>652005455</td><td>2020-08-16</td><td>45132571</td><td>Eugene</td><td>Great host and awesome location with metro within a 10 minute walk</td></tr><tr><td>283446</td><td>1622937</td><td>2012-07-03</td><td>2572009</td><td>Jasper</td><td>Very friendly and generous family. Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. \r\nThe surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself.</td></tr><tr><td>283446</td><td>1635834</td><td>2012-07-05</td><td>2382760</td><td>The Hung</td><td>We had a wonderful stay with Vidhatri family during our travel to Stockholm. Their apartment is large and clean and looks exactly the same pictures shown in the web. The apartment is located in a safe and quite area, and from their place you just need around 20 minute to reach central Stockholm by metro and easily to reach Arlanda airport using SL tickets. Therefore, I strongly recommend Vidhatri apt for your upcoming visit to Stockholm.</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000
