The location of the apartment is so lovely.  Not only are you in what many people feel is the best part of Stockholm (Södermalm) but her flat is situated in an area with lots of green space.  So, the views from your windows, and the overall vibe, make it feel very tranquil.  The apartment itself is so well decorated and I found that I looked forward to spending time there at the end of each day.  The shower is amazing.  The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.  It was very clear that she put much effort into getting the flat ready, making it spotless, and other little thoughtful details.

When my boyfriend and I were heading to downtown Stockholm, we would use the city rental bikes and there is a stand very close to Lovisa's apartment. It's about a 20 minute cycle to the central train station and Stockholm bike lanes are well done. The actual apartment was very clean, great design and absolutely ideal for a couple.

On the other hand all places were reached easily by foot or by metro or bus and there are all facilities you might need (e.g. supermarkets, restaurants) close to the flat. It's a very cosy and really tidy flat. Lovisa arranged some space at her wardrobe and her shoes commode for my private stuff so I felt like at home. I met Lovisa once, she welcomed me warmly and answered quickly all questions I had during that week and asked occasionally if everything is okay. Further I find her guide book very helpful. Thanks again, Lovisa, for your perfect hospitality! "],["164448","472271","2011-08-24","894674","Liliana","Lidia is a very nice person. Very good plase to stay for visit Stockolm.

Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.\n\nThe following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.\nThe address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.\n\nShe uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.\n\nShe does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.\n\nHer TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.\n\nShe has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room\n\nThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.\n\nLi will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked.

Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. \n\nSödermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.\n\nNeed somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.\n\nI can't thank her enough.

The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.

When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!\nIt is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space.

There were three guest teams altogether but we had no difficulty using the bathroom. We had a lot of conversation with Lidia and the other guest, a German lady, sharing cultures and experiences. The most fascinating point with Lidia was that she pinpointed some really nice tourists' attractions in Stockholm, which was quite helpful for us to visit super worthy places. We recommend Lidia's house with both our thumbs up! We will also definitely stay at her house on our next visit to Stockholm for one to two weeks. Our stay at Lidia's house was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. Thank you for everything, Lidia.

The place is a few minutes walk from parks, public swimming areas, attractive neighborhoods, a spectacular statue of Thor slaying a vicious sea serpent named Jörmungandr, and a walking path along a cliff that gives you the best views of the city at night.

Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.\n\nThe following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.\nThe address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.\n\nShe uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.\n\nShe does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.\n\nHer TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.\n\nShe has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room\n\nThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.\n\nLi will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in.</td></tr><tr><td>164448</td><td>289792128</td><td>2018-07-13</td><td>13541212</td><td>Thodoris</td><td>The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places.

We enjoyed the common area, fridge, and microwave that she makes available to her guests - perfect for staying in on a rainy day. As you are in the upper floor of the flat, it can get a little stuffy when the weather is hot (as it was while we were there). Probably not an issue other times of the year or in cooler summers. \n\nWe found the location very convenient - about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan - but we also loved exploring Södermalm, which is a great neighborhood, with great dining options within a 5-10 min walk.

Li is a great, hospitable host, with excellent knowledge of the city and always happy to share tips and suggestions. In her apartment there are a few different rooms for guests, but it’s really nice and quiet at all times as everyone respects the common space. There is a pleasant sitting area for guests on a separate floor, with microwave, fridge, cutlery/cups etc. for guests. Generally, anything you might need is available - toiletries, hairdryers, ironing facilities etc. There is no full kitchen available, but we - and most guests probably - didn’t find it problematic as there is the microwave and lots of cheap places to get food/eat out around. The room we had was very warm (there’s a fan available too!), clean and decorated in a quaint, old-fashioned style with lots of books; plenty of storage space too.

The apartment is an oasis of bright, light calm and wonderfully located in vibrant Hornstull, just round the corner from the Tunnelbanna (although why anyone would take public transport in a city so lovely to walk around beats me). Five star stay in every way- the only downside was having to come back to London... Go to Stockholm, stay at Marie's, just don't you dare try to book the same days as me (I'll definitely be coming back)! Thank you so much again, Marie.

There is no seating, however - which was an issue when making a sit-down meal. The patio/balcony was a great place to sit and enjoy the sun! Very easy to communicate with Marie. Wifi was great (except we accidentally unplugged the router thing, and it eventually ran out of battery and we struggled to figure out how to get internet back!) The room does not have dark curtains; hopefully not an issue for others. Bathroom was a little tight, but doable - no shower curtain, which was odd. I would recommend this place to anyone!

The room was very spacious, sunny and clean, classily decorated with Elizabeth’s taste, with a very nice view of Katarina Bangata STR.

It is a 10 minute walk from Gamla Stan and a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre.\r\n\r\nThe room and bathroom were spacious and is suitable for up to 2 guests. Elisabeth also provided a very nice breakfast. Although the facilities were shared, Elisabeth was very discrete and respected privacy. This place does not have wifi. However, this was not too much of an issue because of the short walking distances around Stockholm. Elisabeth was kind enough to research information about getting around Stockholm, weather etc on our behalf when requested.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend Elisabeth's room for one or two travellers.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>2176688</td><td>2012-09-03</td><td>2452548</td><td>Marko</td><td>Elisabeth is a very charming host whose amiability added a very important and enjoyable dimension to our experience of Stockholm and Sweden.

And although she is living in that flat too, we had a spare key and so were free to go come and go whenever we wanted. And sure the breakfast we had every morning was nicer than buying a pair of rolls every single day.\r\nAll in all it was a nice stay, much better than any hostels or low price hotels you can find for the same price. Only one thing we regret, there were two single beds in our romm with no possibility to put them side by side.\r\nThat being said, we recommend this facility if you're about to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm, capital of Sweden.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>2830063</td><td>2012-11-07</td><td>3516430</td><td>Teresa</td><td>Really great experience staying with Elisabeth.

There's one bathroom with a bath and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose, but it's also spacious and there was never a problem sharing.  The T-bana (Metro) is nearby (0.6 km) but we enjoyed the pretty walk to the Royal Palace (2.2 km) and downtown (2.8 km) areas.  It's an expensive city so check out the lunch specials during the work week and invest in the Stockholm Pass if you like museums (there are many good ones) and boat trips.</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>156762993</td><td>2017-06-01</td><td>116007954</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Elizabeth is a very nice to us and we fell very comfortable during the stay.

Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. \n\nSödermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.\n\nNeed somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.\n\nI can't thank her enough. Even a week was not enough in the most beautiful Scandinavian city. \n\nAnd finally, did I mention you should book this place? :-)</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>194281231</td><td>2017-09-16</td><td>142374402</td><td>Bryce</td><td>I booked accommodation for my mother and her friend with Elisabeth.

She continued to be a happy and fun host for the duration of our week-long stay. The breakfast each morning was fabulous and if we behaved ourselves we were treated with a chocolate =). \n\nThe location was perfect. Right in the middle of Sodermalm, yet down a quiet and very safe feeling street. The train station was only a short walk through the heart of the city.\n\nThe room was spacious and comfortable with towels and linen provided.\n\nThank you very much Elisabeth for making us feel so welcome in your home and city. You made our experience much more fun than staying elsewhere. \n\nBe sure to comment on the light shade in the kitchen during your stay with Elisabeth and watch her face light up!\n\nWe can not recommend Elisabeth and her AirBnB highly enough.\n\nMany thanks,\nLinda and Sue</td></tr><tr><td>206221</td><td>205949551</td><td>2017-10-23</td><td>44602255</td><td>Victor</td><td>We felt like at our home!

As Fredric and I had different work schedules, we often only met briefly. Our interaction was always enjoyable, and Fredric created a great balance between allowing for personal space and offering a sociable atmosphere. Fredric helped me with all of my questions about how to do things in Sweden. I would be happy to stay there again anytime.</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>45186449</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>31909872</td><td>Saskia</td><td>I had a wonderful time in this apartment.

There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>75565359</td><td>2016-05-22</td><td>67850073</td><td>Chengkai</td><td>Fredric is a really nice people and helps me a lot!</td></tr><tr><td>220851</td><td>76399525</td><td>2016-05-27</td><td>71660399</td><td>Hassan</td><td>All I can say is that Fredric was a great host.

Despite being in the middle of everything the apartment is as quiet as being out in the woods; you will sleep very soundly! Mia is a very helpful and knowledgeable host and was full of tips and good advice. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated in whites and blues. The internet speed was plenty to support 2 simultaneous (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at great quality.

It is in a charming building from 1899. Despite being in a vibrant quarter of Stockholm, it is very quiet and peaceful. \r\n\r\nThe metro (tunnelbana) stop is just two minutes away or you can walk to the city centre, which takes around 15 minutes. There are a couple of super-markets close by in case you are spending several days and want to cook for yourselves. \r\n\r\nIf you want to eat out, there is plenty of choice. Try the newly opened Kin Maru restaurant just round their corner. Their vegetarian bibimbap is very good. \r\n\r\nAh and if you are fan of Pippi Longstocking, then you are in for a treat because the house where Astrid Lindgren lived for 60 years is just around the corner. \r\n\r\nWe plan to stay here the next time we visit Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>4056037</td><td>2013-04-06</td><td>4816447</td><td>Suzannah</td><td>Mia is a fantastic host!

Her apartment was clean, had excellent access to public transport, and most importantly was a great central location to downtown Stockholm.  I found that people like to walk in that city, and the location was great for that as well.  The bus from the airport stops just a block away from her place, there is a grocery store within a few hundred yards, and a beautiful park just across the street.  She was timely in returning my emails before the trip and very easy to work with.  I highly recommend using Mia's apartment for anyone spending any time in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>4694432</td><td>2013-05-20</td><td>446826</td><td>Kaizar</td><td>Mia was a fantastic.

She gave me advice on what was best to see and do in my downtime (including leaving a bunch of information for me), gave me step by step instructions on how to find her place from the airport and then when I got there took me on a walk around to familiarise myself with the neighbourhood. Her apartment is a little gem and is so close to everything that you could need.

Vasaparken, with its ice-skating rink, is just across the street, so if you have your own skates you can nip over for a bit of skating before or after your day's activities.  The Hagaparken, with its walking paths, is also quite close.  The apartment faces the courtyard, not the street, so it is very quiet.  It is also very well heated.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was well equipped, the sofa in the living room is very comfortable, and the apartment was very clean and nicer than the pictures.  Mia was very friendly, greeted us exactly as arranged, and gave us a short tour of the neighborhood.  She has a collection of guidebooks and maps of the city in the apartment, and she provided two Access cards for public transport (Stockholm's equivalent of Oyster cards) for our use, which was very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe bed is very soft, which is great for some people and uncomfortable for others.  I can recommend Mia and her apartment highly.\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>238411</td><td>11833618</td><td>2014-04-16</td><td>12460346</td><td>Julius</td><td>Mia was an excellent host.

It was a pleasure to stay and if I was visiting Stockholm again I would certainly consider contacting Mia to see if her place was available.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood was relaxing and centrally located, very nice to walk around with a big leafy park very near.

Getting a travelcard is the best way to see the city. Mia met with us on the night before our departure. She is an intelligent, delightful person who takes pride in being a host. If she is in Stockholm to greet her guests, I am sure that she can give them terrific insights regarding her city.

Would highly recommend getting to meet her if you stay at her place!\r\nThe area is very nice surrounded by many restaurants and a beautiful park.

We loved our stay in her apartment-- good location, and easy to walk to from the central station, if you like walking. We never used public transportation during our stay, and were delighted by the availability of coffee shops, grocery stores, and antique stores in the area. The apartment itself is in a very secure building, with a well-stocked kitchen for basic cooking, and the extra bed is actually extremely comfortable, even though it's a fold-up one! Mia left us hot chocolate when the weather turned cold, was kind enough to help me by actually taking care of my laundry for me, and was extremely understanding when we had to arrive a day late, even though she didn't get our message in time.

While Mia wasn't in town during my and my friend's stay, she did an amazing job of staying in touch, coordinating, and providing helpful tips throughout our visit. She's incredibly thoughtful and responsive. Not to mention that the apartment is perfect for two travelers and is nice and quiet, as it is set back from the street. It is a very well-appointed apartment and has a good, functional kitchen if you've had a long (and maybe cold) day of touring around and would prefer a warm, relaxed night in cooking your own dinner. Vasastan is a vibrant neighborhood with many restaurants, coffeehouse, and bar options, though the apartment is convenient for those interested in Gamla Stan or Soldermalm too, given that the quick and efficient subway system is just a few steps away. Stockholm is a lovely city and this is the perfect apartment from which to explore it!</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>917789</td><td>2012-02-13</td><td>1612490</td><td>Mike</td><td>Lovely host and ideal location for Sodermalm as well as getting to the exhibition centre where I was working.

I tend to stay to myself and this is a real change for me to stay in someones home. I have been in Sweden for over a month and I have never had a better sleep than what I had at Lidias.  She cannot seem to do enough for you. I have already passed her name along to a colleage of mine who frequently has people coming to Sweden on business.

Lidia is extremely welcoming, and keen for you to have the best experience of this wonderful city.

Her home is located in a fairly central neighbourhood, a 5-10 minute easy walk from the metro and commuter trains. The area is bustling in the evenings, with lots of restaurants and bars.  The old town is a 15 minute walk away. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.  I got back very late each night and that's not a problem as long as you are respectful of the other guests and don't make any noise. Walking back late at night was also completely safe. There are 3-4 rooms located off the first floor landing, including a bathroom which everyone shares and which is very clean. There are shared tea/coffee making facilities and Lidia was very accommodating in providing me with the use of an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast is very generous.

Lidia is an excellent host: super friendly, very keen on making sure her guests feel instantly at home...somehow there always seems to have a cup of coffee or tea ready :) So thanks for the great time, I do plan to be back and I recommend very much to anybody intending to travel to STO to see if there's a room available at Lidia's.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>11951549</td><td>2014-04-20</td><td>11624311</td><td>Michael</td><td>Lidia was an excellent host.

The description was accurate. I stayed in the single room. It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!  </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>34472972</td><td>2015-06-08</td><td>29483133</td><td>Leonard</td><td>Lidia has been an extremely wonderful host.

She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  \r\n\r\nThe room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   \r\n\r\nThere were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  \r\n\r\nIt is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.\r\n\r\nLidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter).  </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>45599868</td><td>2015-09-04</td><td>19005461</td><td>Karandeep (KD)</td><td>I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.\r\n\r\nGiven another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>46618008</td><td>2015-09-12</td><td>17613139</td><td>Michael</td><td>Lidia hat mir eine sehr detaillierte Beschreibung geschickt wie ich zu Ihr komme. Die Lage ist wunderbar zentral und alles ist gut zu erreichen. Zum Flughafen kann man direkt durchfahren. Sie war sehr flexibel was die Schlüsselübergabe anging.

I took an overnight flight to Stockholm & Lidia was kind enough to let me in to drop off my luggage in the morning, which was wonderful.  The SL train stop near her place is on the same line as Arlanda airport, which made it very easy to get to & her directions from the train stop to the apartment made the place very easy to find.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>47311337</td><td>2015-09-17</td><td>22175879</td><td>Andrew</td><td>I don't have enough space to leave an adequate  review for Lidia and her place. To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>47470360</td><td>2015-09-19</td><td>37853399</td><td>Martin</td><td>Ett varmt välkomnande. Visade runt på ett mycket bra sätt.

It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.\r\n\r\nThe room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue. \r\n\r\nLidia was very helpful with maps and suggestions of things to do, and tips about public transit. </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>49598434</td><td>2015-10-05</td><td>37869951</td><td>Melanie</td><td>I felt very welcome when I arrive at Lidia's.

She gave me a lot of information and good suggestions how to come around in Stockholm. As my cable for to charge my mobil phone didn´t work she borrowed me her cable for the time I stayed there. So I was able to take the photos and keep in contact with my family and friends. I was even able to practise my swedish with her. She was really a patient person to listen to me and to talk swedish with me even if I did not speak it so well. She had during my visit also some other guests staying there and they were also very nice. I enjoeyd the conversation with Lidia and her guests. It was so nice to stay in her flat,  I feld like home!

There is one single room and 2 double rooms. There is one bathroom for all three rooms. There are locks on all the doors and a common area equipped with a mini-fridge, hot water heater, eating utensils and a microwave. Great wifi and quite clean.   Had no problem with the other guests and with sharing a bathroom. Great experience. \n\nRoom: cozy and cute. I didn't spend much time there so the size of the room did not bother me at all. Lidia was great and made sure the trash was emptied every day. I had enough towels, a water glass and she even made my bed. :). There is a desk in the room with 2 lamps along with an overhead lamp. The room faces a playground area/park so sometimes you will hear kids playing soccer but it was not a problem for me. It does get plenty of light (I actually had sunshine during my trip to Stockholm) so it made me wish I had brought my eye mask.  \n\nLocation: Great location. Public transportation (T-bana & bus stops) around the corner. Near yummy bakeries and delicious coffee houses. I had an early morning cruise on the Viking Line. It was an easy 30-min walk to their harbor. She lives on the 5th floor of her building but there is a great elevator. \n\nLidia is a great host and she wants to be a resource to her guests. She gave me great directions to her apartment from Arlanda. Once I arrived, we had coffee and she talked to me about Stockholm and all that it has to offer. She was very kind and you can tell she enjoy hosting us tourists. It was nice to come home to a friendly face -- she even remembered some of my random Stockholm travel plans!  Thank you, Lidia. </td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>97096905</td><td>2016-08-25</td><td>24741850</td><td>Diana</td><td>Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.\r\n\r\nMy parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.\r\n\r\nMy single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.\r\n\r\nI really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.\r\n\r\nLidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her.</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>98021560</td><td>2016-08-29</td><td>76850236</td><td>Haruka</td><td>Her hospitality was perfect!!\r\nShe was always kind for me:)\r\nAnd she told me how to go the sightseeing sight or some Swedish words!

Yo realicé la mayoría de trayectos hacia la ciudad andando, y era febrero y había nieve, es decir, el alojamiento está suficientemente cerca para ir dando un agradable paseo hasta el centro de Estocolmo. \nLí es una excelente anfitriona, atenta, rápida en responder, deseosa de ayudar y de orientar con buenas informaciones sobre la ciudad. \nMi habitación no era muy grande, pero era luminosa, estaba limpia y bien dotada en lo esencial.  La habitación está en la parte de arriba del piso (es tipo duplex) y fuera de la habitación hay un salón-zona común con sofás, neveras, microondas.. etc.. que te dá un espacio agradable para otros usos antes de irte a dormir.  \nCreo que en conjunto es un lugar muy recomendable como opción para alojarse.  \nGracias Lí!!</td></tr><tr><td>242188</td><td>236433101</td><td>2018-02-19</td><td>94190128</td><td>Jillian</td><td>The stay at Li's was very pleasant.

The bathroom was very clean and great pressure in the shower, always nice to warm up after a long day exploring. Li was fantastic as a host and gave great tips for traveling around and what to see. Check in was a breeze, my flight got in at midnight, as it was delayed. Li was so kind and stayed up until 2 am giving me helpful directions from the airport to her place and getting me settled into her apartment. She went above and beyond that night and I felt so safe knowing that in a foreign city she was there to help me even though I arrived so late. She also let me leave my bags at her place on the final day (I had a night flight) so I could finish my time in Stockholm without having to drag around my luggage.

Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. \nIn de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. \nLi antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.

Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.\r\nThe room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. \r\nI don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work.</td></tr><tr><td>259722</td><td>1600824</td><td>2012-07-01</td><td>2124234</td><td>Romain</td><td>Marcelo is the best hote of the world !\r\nVery simpatic polite and available.\r\ni have enjoy my travel of 2 months in marcelo's house !\r\nYou can choose marcelo without problems !\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>259722</td><td>2069730</td><td>2012-08-22</td><td>3247493</td><td>Jc</td><td>I enjoyed my stay at Marcelo's apartment..

The room was spacious and comfortable. I would clarify that the 16 minutes to the city center refers only to the time on the train. You have to walk 5 minutes to the station and if you miss a train, as I did, you may have to wait about 10 minutes for the next. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4127917</td><td>2013-04-12</td><td>2404401</td><td>Nele</td><td>I stayed three nights here and I really enjoyed!\r\nIt's a bit far from the city centre, so that may be a little bit inconvenient, but on the other hand: It's very quiet here and it's just five minutes walk to the underground and a supermarket.\r\nI only met Linnéa briefly, but she seems to be a very nice person. I also had the opportunity to meet her two nice Italian friends!\r\nAnd oh yes...the room is spacious and clean - so, just perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4252803</td><td>2013-04-22</td><td>5450665</td><td>Sarah</td><td>Linnea was an excellent host - we stayed with her for 3 nights during the first part of our trip in Sweden. Both Linnea and her house mates were very friendly and welcoming and the house was a calm and wholesome place to be. Lake and woodland very close by as well as direct transport links to the buzzing city centre. Linnea kept in frequent contact prior to our trip which enabled us to find the house very easily. We'd definitely recommend her!</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>4440756</td><td>2013-05-05</td><td>6167897</td><td>Emilio</td><td>The stay over att Linne was awsome, she was a nice host and easy going as well.

The house is big, my room was big and confortable too and the flat just reminded me of my times at university: the (Hidden by Airbnb) are young and handsome. And yes it's true, the house is near a wood and a lake and most of all is very easy to reach because is just three minutes walking from the last stop of the line 18 of the underground. I coudn't ask for more. As about Linnea, she's just nice and pretty, quite a sweet host. I recommend this choice.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>7255148</td><td>2013-09-13</td><td>8263257</td><td>David</td><td>I liked the big room with hangers for the clothes, the place is very quiet and clean.

But that is not as important as many would think (though it clearly is an added plus!); what matters is that the place is a haven of friendliness and of calm energy. I had a string of extremely busy days in Stockholm during my booking, but always knew that the stress and pressure would go away as soon as I entered the flat and enjoyed some tea at the kitchen area or talked a bit with Linnea’s lovely family - big and small – that resided in one of the other rooms. The topics varied from the merits of fivefinger running shoes to barista ordering techniques, Swedish school curricula, Albanian dialects, welfare state reform, philosophy and life in Sweden in general… All in all, a positive experience at a place and with people that I could not recommend enough! </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>35243089</td><td>2015-06-16</td><td>33629285</td><td>Susanne</td><td>\"Die immerhin 10 Tage, die ich bei Linnéa verbracht habe, waren für mich eine wunderbare Zeit. Linnéa und ihr Zuhause hatten daran großen Anteil. \r\nAusgewählt habe ich diese Unterkunft ursprünglich aufgrund der Beschreibung  \"\"Nature stay\"\". Und es stimmt.

She was very kind and her house was as described in her listing. It was a good location for exploring the city of Stockholm and the surrounding areas.  I slept very well there.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>65726809</td><td>2016-03-16</td><td>9671505</td><td>Goo</td><td>Nice young family with cute baby!  The house is situated away from the city as the listing says, but it is quite easy to go back and forth from the city, takes literally 30mins including the walk from metro/train. Linnéa lent me the spare transport card so i could top up with the 24 hours pass and that was convenient.\n\nThe walk up is easy but if you are arriving with a big luggage like me in winter time, be prepared for some pushing and rolling.\n\nI didnt see much of Linnéa as she was away with baby, but her bf Arnando took good care of me and even bought breakfast items for me. They even recommended coffee spots for me as i am a coffee hunter, and all the suggestions were great!\n\nHouse and room is big and surely enough space for two people. The trail literally behind the house around the lake is amazing and so is the nature area on the other side of the lake. Went for a nice walk and took me half an hour to get to the other side.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>66302511</td><td>2016-03-20</td><td>2487043</td><td>David</td><td>Linnéa was a fantastic host. I was staying for a few days with the intention of cramming in as much of Stockholm as I could. The apartment is in a great location. It's a really short work to the Metro as well as the beautiful lake (which was covered in a layer of snow on the first day of Spring!). The bed looked comfy and I can attest that it's even better than it looks. Towels and basic toiletries were a nice touch, though I didn't partake it was greatly appreciated and I imagine will be invaluable to those travelling light. She was also kind enough to offer breakfast (which I foolishly didn't realise and didn't make very much use of). Though I didn't see much of my hosts, they were kind and gracious to my comings and goings. Definitely beats a boring hotel! I just wish I could have stayed longer and chatted more.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>69064941</td><td>2016-04-09</td><td>10174350</td><td>Rónán</td><td>The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival.

The apartment is a good size and within about a 7 minute walk to the metro station. It takes about an hour to get into the main city of Stockholm (but there were train upgrades happening which made it a little slower). Linnea purchased some breakfast food for me to prepare in the mornings which was a nice perk. I would stay here again if visiting Stockholm another time. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>310316578</td><td>2018-08-19</td><td>203816250</td><td>Kamil</td><td>Women was very helpful and optimistyc too gest. </td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>326976972</td><td>2018-09-23</td><td>211500865</td><td>Miranda</td><td>Had an incredible time at Linnéa. It´s close to everything you could ask for: close to nature, close to shoping & close to the green subway line, connecting Farsta to the rest of Stockholm. But the biggest highlight was the host herself. Kind & considerate, she made sure I felt at home the moment I stepped through the door. Overall: 10/10, would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>330254072</td><td>2018-09-30</td><td>13573376</td><td>Fathima</td><td>Mycket nöjd med lägenheten i sig och med kommunikationen.

Honestly the area is (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a daily thriving colourful fruit and veg market encompassed by one big mall. You could easily lose yourself for half a day. It also has great transport links whether you want to head in town or out of town. The other side of Farsta boasts a beautiful park that sits on the edge of a huge lake. The cafe sells mouthwatering cakes. But the piece d resistance has to be the family we stayed with who were top notch hosts that were extremely helpful  with directions and places to see. You felt more like you were doing a homestay rather than Airbnb. Linnea lives in a lovely area and we would certainly come back for more</td></tr><tr><td>278311</td><td>652005455</td><td>2020-08-16</td><td>45132571</td><td>Eugene</td><td>Great host and awesome location with metro within a 10 minute walk</td></tr><tr><td>283446</td><td>1622937</td><td>2012-07-03</td><td>2572009</td><td>Jasper</td><td>Very friendly and generous family. Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. \r\nThe surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself.</td></tr><tr><td>283446</td><td>1635834</td><td>2012-07-05</td><td>2382760</td><td>The Hung</td><td>We had a wonderful stay with Vidhatri family during our travel to Stockholm. Their apartment is large and clean and looks exactly the same pictures shown in the web. The apartment is located in a safe and quite area, and from their place you just need around 20 minute to reach central Stockholm by metro and easily to reach Arlanda airport using SL tickets. Therefore, I strongly recommend Vidhatri apt for your upcoming visit to Stockholm.</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000

The flat itself is beautiful, with lots of light, wooden floors and a fantastic kitchen, and Lovisa is a very helpful and organised host. I would definitely stay there again, and can thoroughly recommend it. "],["good","Both Lovisa and her apartment are as good as it gets, in my experience.  The location of the apartment is so lovely.  Not only are you in what many people feel is the best part of Stockholm (Södermalm) but her flat is situated in an area with lots of green space.  So, the views from your windows, and the overall vibe, make it feel very tranquil.  The apartment itself is so well decorated and I found that I looked forward to spending time there at the end of each day.  The shower is amazing.  The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.  It was very clear that she put much effort into getting the flat ready, making it spotless, and other little thoughtful details.  I look forward to staying in Lovisa's flat again as soon as I return to Stockholm!"],["good","My husband and I rented Lovisa's flat for a week.

I was so lucky to have found it and I enjoyed every minute of it during my 8 day stay there. Simply stated: you must stay here if you are in Stockholm.

Gamla Stan is only a quick and beautiful 25 minute walk away, the Stureplan district is maybe a 20 minute walk away. In the immediate neighborhood there is a small grocery store right across the street, an amazing Thai food stand/gourmet truck one block away, and for any Americans who may have withdrawls from lack of ranch dressing and an overabundance of ice (aka Me!) there is a Hard Rock Cafe 2-3 blocks away. Not to mention the numerous bakeries and coffeehouses within one block.

It was a relief being accepted by her after several others responded that they were going to be using their flats at the time we would be in Stockholm.   The rooms in this flat are spacious and light filled.  The bed was the most comfortable in our whole three week travels through Scandinavia.  The elevator was a big help in getting our luggage into and back out of the building.  The nice marble spiral staircase was not a problem when we weren't carrying heavy loads even with the apartment up 4 flights - and we are seniors.  Another convenience we appreciated was the laundry facility in the basement, though it took some guessing to figure out how to work the machines since we don't know Swedish.  Cecilia had a newly opened box of laundry detergent in the flat which was a big help once we found it.  We needed so little and didn't want to have to buy a whole box.  We also liked having recycling and trash disposal on the ground floor. The Coop grocery store nearby carried organic food selections which was important to us, and a good bakery was next door to it.  Having our breakfast and evening meal in the flat saved us lots of money.  Transportation around the city was very easy from here by subway.  All in all it was a very pleasant and convenient place to stay in Stockholm."],["good","Very good location.

The apartment has a perfect location - the metro station is right across the street, there are many bus stops in the area, the same for big supermarkets (Hemköp, Ica, Coop). There's also a wonderful bakery and a systembolaget really close. I highly recommend walking up the street to go to Monteliusvägen - a wonderful path which gives you an amazing view of the city. The Old Town can be reached in 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by metro. If you're into vintage and retro, the SoFo district is really close and a few vintage shops are actually really close to Cecliia's place.\r\nThe contact with the host was really great - Cecilia helped me a lot and was really quick at responding.

Once we had the keys and the code to the downstairs door, we were happily ensconced in Cecilia's truly beautiful Stockholm apartment.  It is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and eat-in kitchen, plus TWO balconies. Unlike many apartments that we have rented, this one was obviously not simply an investment rent-a-place, but her very own apartment. We felt like we were friends who had made arrangements to use her place while she was out of town.  This intimacy had some distinct advantages. The kitchen, for instance, was fully equipped and set up because Cecilia, who we would guess is an excellent cook, had cooked there recently herself. It was a pleasure to prepare meals there and eat at the little kitchen table. The art on the walls and the various objets de art throughout the apartment always provided visual entertainment and often food for thought. The apartment was very clean and, well, charming. The only drawback was that there was not a lot of space for us to stow our own stuff, but we quickly figured out that minor problem and enjoyed ourselves in this sophisticated and beautiful space.\r\n\r\nThe location was also very satisfying.  Located on one of the main drags in Soderholm, filled with cafes and small shops, the apartment was an interesting fifteen to twenty minute stroll to the Gamla Stan, Stockhplm's old town. There were grocery stores within a half a block, subway stations five to ten minutes walk, and the one of the City Bike stands was only a few blocks away.

Sam did a good job on his monologues but still seemed new to the questions that were asked occasionally. He would do his best to answer but it sometimes felt like he was blindly shooting from the hip. Really nice guide, though. Very personable and easy to communicate with.

Because it's so close to Karlaplan (I call it the circle garden), it's easy to find your way home with a map. It's like the center of Ostermalm and many streets lead straight to it.\r\n\r\nI felt very safe. You need at least 3 keys just to get in (4 if he's not home). The neighborhood feels very safe too.\r\n\r\nInside is very modern and clean. Maybe this will describe it enough: When you lock the door to the bathroom, the outside handle glows red to let the outside know there is someone in there. The shower is clever and space-saving. It's made of 2 glass doors that swing open to form a box. When you're done, they swing towards the wall so there's more room. Although, I thought the bathroom was plenty spacious anyway.\r\n\r\nThere's a Fruit/vegetable stand outside along with a small street vendor that sells fast food, and a McDonald's. But if you are serious about buying groceries, Edwin will tell you where you can get them cheaper.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the street view here. That's the back part. The front, where you will most likely always come from, is very nice.\r\n\r\nIt's very quiet even though you are above a major street. At night, it is almost dead silent. And the room has a double-paned window and a blackout shade. It is annoying, however, when it rains because you can hear the loud rain droplets hit the sill. If that bothers you, bring ear plugs. I usually fall asleep very easily, and the sound kept me up.\r\n\r\nThere is a place to do laundry downstairs, but you have to get Edwin to reserve it ahead of time.\r\n\r\nIn terms of tourist advice, I didn't get much from him.

There was a hairdryer provided too, but there was no place to plug it in in the bathroom (and the mirror in there was too high for me to see myself anyway); it could have been plugged in the kitchen, but that had no mirror either.

The separate entrance from the hallway, shielded by both inner and outer doors, makes me guess this space was once servants' quarters.

There were only two minor inconveniences (which were not a big deal and I guess I wasn't paying great attention to the pictures): one was that the little kitchenette had no sink and the second was that the shower is constructed without a floor that slopes down to the drain, so you have to use a window scraper to get the water off of the floor and into the drain (the curtain doesn't really stretch, so it doesn't give much coverage). I only stayed 2 nights, so these factors were not a huge inconvenience. The other thing is that I wish I had been notified that there would be construction going on in the building (the hammering on the landing started at around 7:30 am each morning). Again, not a deal breaker, just wish I had been able to take into consideration when choosing where to stay. \r\n\r\nOverall, comfortable bed, lovely location, but with a few inconveniences and slow wifi."],["excellent","Very lovely little studio flat.

It was also very quiet on the fourth floor, and just off the main road, so quieter.\n\nPar was very hospitable, and checked us in with a warm welcome, with plenty of tips and left us sparkling wine. He also let us leave luggage for the day at the end of the stay, and was very easy to communicate with before the stay. This was only my third Air B and B, and the best yet.\n\nThe apartment is very handy (30 seconds walk) to bus routes 3 to the Old Town, 50 and 54 (to Kungstradgarden, where you catch no 7 tram to the Djurgarden attractions) so was excellent for public transport. 10 minutes walk to the City Hall, and 3 minutes to the waterside Malarpaviljorgen floating bar/restauarant). Metro 5 minutes away. Convenience store opposite, or ICA supermarket and several restaurants (we liked French Bergamott) with 5 minutes down a small hill). So, ideally situated, in a local but safe neighbourhood. \n\nThanks Par."],["good","Pär is a super host for a very good reason. Not only was the apartment great and exactly as represented in the listing but also he was very helpful on the check-in.  There are a couple of things that aren’t covered in the listing and the reviews which might be good to know. First off, there are some stairs because the apartment is on a “half floor.” Despite the fact that we both use canes, this was not a serious problem especially since Pär helped us in with the luggage. The other thing that was not in the listing was that the building has laundry facilities in the basement.

This area of Kungsholmen became my favorite part of Stockholm, in the city but with a more neighborhood feel.\r\n\r\nAs for the apartment itself...absolutely perfect. It's a studio, so it's small of course, but there was an amazing \"\"a place for everything and everything in its place\"\" vibe. I stayed for 4 weeks but never had to contact Pernilla as everything I possibly could have needed was there"],["good","I stayed in Pernilla's apartment for one month, while in Stockholm for work. Prior to arrival, Pernilla was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. My arrival date was a few days before she was scheduled to leave but she accommodated my stay anyway so I could come straight to the apartment from the airport, which was very helpful so I did not have to find a second place for those few days. \r\nUpon arrival she showed me around the apartment and the building, suggested some highlights of the neighborhood, and let me know she had left some breakfast food and tea in the kitchen to get me started. However, even if she had not been there to show me around, there were detailed written instructions left on the counter.\r\nThe apartment itself was perfect for me. It is ideal for one person with everything needed for a long stay like mine. The kitchen is equipped with dishes, pots/pans, utensils, etc. and has a dishwasher but no microwave, so food must be heated in the oven. Everything worked properly and was easy to use.  The apartment is setup in a functional way so that, even if it appears small at first, all the spaces are utilized well giving the sense of a larger apartment. Also, there was space cleared in the closet and bathroom so I could store my things.\r\nThe building has an elevator, however, the apartment is on the top floor and the elevator arrives one floor below with stairs that lead to the apartment one flight up. This was not a problem for me, but maybe good to know if you have a lot of luggage or trouble with stairs. I also did not have problems scheduling and using the laundry room which is in another building. \r\nThe location was also perfect. It is directly across the street from a metro entrance, only one stop from Stockholm Central Station where it is possible to transfer to any other train line. There is also a full grocery store on the same block that is open late and very convenient. Although there are shops, restaurants, banks, etc. nearby, the apartment is not too far from the waterfront where there is a trail for walking along the water (and Stockholm is beautiful any time of year).

It is located in the nicest, most trendy area of Stockholm, close to restaurants and shops, but really nice and quiet next to a park. The appartement is clean and has all you need. I would recommend it without any doubt! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lovisa's flat is an amazing place to stay in Stockholm - located in a 1920s housing development on a small hill and surrounded by parks, the area feels calm and secluded even though it's minutes from Skanstull's underground station, bars, restaurants and great shopping. The flat itself is beautiful, with lots of light, wooden floors and a fantastic kitchen, and Lovisa is a very helpful and organised host. I would definitely stay there again, and can thoroughly recommend it. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Both Lovisa and her apartment are as good as it gets, in my experience.  The location of the apartment is so lovely.  Not only are you in what many people feel is the best part of Stockholm (Södermalm) but her flat is situated in an area with lots of green space.  So, the views from your windows, and the overall vibe, make it feel very tranquil.  The apartment itself is so well decorated and I found that I looked forward to spending time there at the end of each day.  The shower is amazing.  The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.  It was very clear that she put much effort into getting the flat ready, making it spotless, and other little thoughtful details.  I look forward to staying in Lovisa's flat again as soon as I return to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My husband and I rented Lovisa's flat for a week.

The flat itself was perfect for our stay. Cute, stylish and incredible well taken care of.\r\n\r\nLovisa was a great host! Very friendly and seemed to go our her way to make sure we had a good stay. My first impression of the flat was how clean it was and Lovisa had clearly cleaned every corner to make sure it was spotless.\r\n\r\nI can highly recommend the flat to anyone wishing to rent a flat in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My wife and I have stayed in Lovisa's SOFO apartment previously. We were impressed last time and this time was no different. The apartment is super clean, has everything you need and more, excellent internet, heating, washing and all the mod-cons. \r\n\r\nBy what really makes it is Lovisa as a host. We have travelled quite extensively and truly top shelf quality. Friendly, easy to deal with, suggests great non-touristy things.Not only did we stay comfortably, but also experienced what 'real life' in Stockholm is. \r\n\r\nCannot recommend her place enough.

When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!\nIt is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space.

From the info she provided, I could have mistaken her for her pro advice on the sights to cover in Stockholms / admission fee prices to some and even which part of the train to stand in order to alight nearer to Saluhall at Ostermalm station (it's in front).

Trains pass very often...we have never waited more than 10-15 minutes \n- 700 metres from the nearest metro station (in case you don't want to change from metro to trains)\n- 2 minutes walking from the nearest supermarket \n- 25 minutes walking from the old town</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia was an excellent host... so kind and helpful! She was very acc</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia's place was in an excellent location close to a metro stop and matched the descriptions and pictures.  Lidia stayed up late for us when our train got delayed and we arrived well after midnight, and she was very helpful showing us things to do around Stockholm. She also kept our bedroom very tidy. Overall, a great host! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia is a very friendly host. The communication was very interesting. She made good suggestions. This district of Stockholm has many advantages. Many bars and resraurants and the way to the old town is not far. On one hand you can walk or you take the public traffic.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We enjoyed our stay at Lidia's during our five days in Stockholm.  The apartment is well located and comfortable.  Lidia was very attentive, providing excellent information about the city's cultural offerings.  We would stay with Lidia on our next trip to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>From the very start, my communication with with Li was excellent: she answered quickly and in a very welcoming and pleasant way.\n\n\n\nBefore I arrived, she provided me with clear and accurate instructions how to reach her flat in three different ways - the quickest, the normal and the cheapest including buying a multi-day ticket for all the public transport in Stockholm.\nI recommend buying that ticket as you can also use it for getting from and to the airport.\n\n\n\nWhen I arrived, Li welcomed me and offered me a coffee. She was cordial and provide me with maps and a wide selection of explanations and recommendations for the city, museum, interesting places and transport to and from her place.\n\nLocation is very good. 5 min walk to J train to the airport, 10 min walk to 2 different Metro stops and busses. Many supermarkets around as well as coffee shops, bars and restaurants.\n\nThe room is on the second floor, which guarantees complete privacy. Li rents two rooms on that floor. Luckily for me, I was the only guest so I enjoyed a double room and a private toilet and shower.\n\nThe apartment is perfectly clean, and Li provides all the necessary things, such as a microwave, fridge, kettle, instant coffee and milk. The apartment has all the utensils and crockery to prepare a simple meal in the microwave. The room is small but has enough space for what you need with many electrical sockets. Very comfortable bed.\n\nLi was a great host, a pleasant conversationalist if you want, but respects your privacy if you want to be alone.\n\nI really enjoyed being in Li's flat and meeting her. She also change old banknotes for new ones when she understood that the bank would only replace notes that were out of circulation only for bank account holders.\n\nRecommended with all my heart!\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed in Linda's home for there days and it was super good! The apartment was nice and tidy and it had a quiet neighborhood. Linda gave us some good advice on our travel plans which was very useful. She is a kind lady who loves guests from all over the world. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a great pleasure for us to stay at Li's room. She gave us a very good introduction about Stockholm and made us feel like at home. Thank you very much!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The host is very kind and friendly. The house has a good ubication, near one of the main stations of Stockholm</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good stay at Li´s home. She was extremely hospitable even after just returning from the hospital (!). The location is good, but note that with a late arrival (after 23:30) a direct connection from Arlanda by train is not possible. Room is rather small but has everything you need, and the bathroom is large. Reccomended.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location of Li’s apartment is quite convenient to almost all the sightseeing places in Stockholm. And Li is an amazing host, she shared all the information we needed with us, and was very helpful! I’d definitely recommend to stay at her place.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>It is really a great experience to practice Yoga with Solveig’s perfect instructions. There are a few things that I am really impressed on: 1)\nShe chooses a perfect location which is outdoor while can enjoy the sun, the wind and the Frankfurt City sky view at the same time; 2) Solveig’s coaching is with her own peace and enjoyment that I can feel the calmness and I believe she enjoys the process for each coaching; 3) There are some certain Yoga post that I am always struggle on for years but Solveig gave me excellent tips that how to correct my movement; 4) It was also a surprise that her Airbnb booking includes an detail Frankfurt guide with a decent presentation, moreover she arranged a coffee time in the Cafe that we both can relax and talk for our life and lifestyle right after the Yoga Practice. It is a very good experience, worth recommending! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li's place is in an excellent location to be able to walk or jump on the metro to any where in the city. Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.\n\nThe following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.\nThe address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.\n\nShe uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.\n\nShe does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.\n\nHer TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.\n\nShe has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room\n\nThere is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.\n\nLi will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places. The room was good; everything you would expect from a short-term stay. Li was very good in making check in extremely convenient and was also extremely hospitable. I definitely recommend the place.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great experience to try yoga or continue practicing. Solveig was very attentive not only during class but also sharing her tips about the city. The place was also very nice, by the riverside, with a beautiful view for some pics and a nearby cafe perfect for a sunset drink. Loved the experience!  What an amazing way to end the day,  enjoy a different perspective of the city and create a good memory. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a really good experience with Solveig. She is a great yoga teacher but also a very nice and warm person that makes you feel comfortable throughout the class. The practice is suitable for all levels and time and location were perfect. At the end of the class, she also shared with us very useful tips about Frankfurt and nice spots while we had a drink. 100% recommendable :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li was flexible about arrival time and check-in and gave good directions to reach her flat from the Södra station. In the check-in process she provided a map of Stockholm, oriented us to public transportation options, and gave her recommendations on things to do. \n\nLi also let us switch rooms at check-in for a bit more space. We enjoyed the common area, fridge, and microwave that she makes available to her guests - perfect for staying in on a rainy day. As you are in the upper floor of the flat, it can get a little stuffy when the weather is hot (as it was while we were there). Probably not an issue other times of the year or in cooler summers. \n\nWe found the location very convenient - about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan - but we also loved exploring Södermalm, which is a great neighborhood, with great dining options within a 5-10 min walk. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much - it felt more like staying with family than an AirBnB. \n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia is an excellent host. She was really nice and gave us a lot of useful information. It's very easy to comunicate with her.\nThe appartement is well located, near the commuter rail and metro. The bedroom was comfortable and clean. Highly recommend !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>everything was nice, very good public transport, recomend to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I miss Li. She is a very adorable lady. She loves her city so much that she could give us many useful and positive suggestion on the traveling. Her house is warm and makes me feeling like being at home.  It just takes you 5 minutes to get to the stations and you could get the city center within 15 minutes. There are some supermarket nearby too. This is absolutely the best choice for you in Stockholm, it would not disappoint you. Thanks Li creating a good memory for me in this city.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li was very fast in her responses. she provided us all needed info at arrival, described us a Stockholm in a nutshell . Room was private and clean. I recommend this place. It is worth it's money. Location is also very good!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>民宿是一个老奶奶的家,布置的超温馨地方也很好,老奶奶人真的很棒,帮我们计划行程还泡茶给我们喝,和她聊天超开心,强烈推荐!\nIt's really nice to live in Li's house which located in a good place, she helped us a lot on our trip and we had a nice chat, it's much better than what we expect!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li was a perfect host and she gave us a lot of advices. The place was clean and in a very good position. Thank you a lot Li!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Li was amazing!  The space is very comfortable and spacious, and in a fantastic location (walking distance to areas with restaurants / bars / shopping in Södermalm, and right next to a train station with easy access to the whole city).  \n\nEven more importantly, though, Li is a lovely host and extremely helpful with local tips, maps, and guides.  When we arrived, Li brewed us a cup of coffee and sat down with us for a quick summary of what to do in Stockholm.  She made us feel very welcome, and gave us great suggestions for what to do with our time in the city.\n\nCan’t recommend enough!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>everything was very good</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li is a wonderful host, very hospitable. Her place is very centrally located, close to public transport. She is always there to help in case of any questions and her tips are extremely useful for tourists. Overall we had an excellent stay at her place.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Li is an incredibly sweet lady, who immediately makes you feel welcome in her home. When we arrived, she offered us all kinds of brochures and maps of Stockholm, explained its different areas and public transit. The room, the TV room and the washroom are very clean and orderly. The apartment is located perfectly, close to several tram, bus, and metro stations, as well as the hip area of Södermalm with its thousand bars and restaurants. Li is an amazing host, who made our stay a great experience.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li’s place is perfectly located - quiet and safe (even in the late evening/at night), but also very near to main streets of Södermalm, numerous underground/bus stops (only a few minutes away from the Old Town/Gamla Stan, or half an hour’s walk), lots of lovely cafés and restaurants as well. Li is a great, hospitable host, with excellent knowledge of the city and always happy to share tips and suggestions. In her apartment there are a few different rooms for guests, but it’s really nice and quiet at all times as everyone respects the common space. There is a pleasant sitting area for guests on a separate floor, with microwave, fridge, cutlery/cups etc. for guests. Generally, anything you might need is available - toiletries, hairdryers, ironing facilities etc. There is no full kitchen available, but we - and most guests probably - didn’t find it problematic as there is the microwave and lots of cheap places to get food/eat out around. The room we had was very warm (there’s a fan available too!), clean and decorated in a quaint, old-fashioned style with lots of books; plenty of storage space too. The place is very well maintained and we were well looked after - I would definitely recommend Li’s place as it is great value for money (especially location, location, location!).</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li hosted my friends for 9 days. They had a great stay. The room was comfortable, and she had excellent suggestions for them- with navigation, places to see and about Stockholm in general. Would recommend staying with her :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great place to stay un Stockolm! Very good value for money. Centrally located, easy to get to from the airport and everywhere in the city. Cozy home with all the utilities, nice and quiet too. Li was a great host :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Marie S is the best flat owner :)  The apartment looks just like the photos.  It was spotless, and she left delicious fresh fruit and coffee to welcome me to Stockholm.  The flat is located in an amazing location for long walks and is close to transportation all over Stockholm.  I can't say enough about how nice Marie is, and how lovely it was that she trusted me with her plants.  Also, the balcony is wonderful and romantic.  Love her and her flat.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice location, well equipped kitchen, nice sunny balcony. \r\nIf you are travelling with a small baby, as we did, it is good to know that the elevator is rather small. Our baby carriage did not fit in (unless dismounted), which was a bit impractical.\r\nAlso, from the practical standpoint, we would have liked a normal size table and some more electric light (instead of the many candles), but I suppose this is a question of taste.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is very nice, and very easy to get around from it. Nice cafés, an independent cinema around the block, good metro connection and the plus of an airport bus around the corner. Beautiful plants keep you company while visiting Stockholm. Will stay there again. It feels like a home, and beds are very comfortable. The balcony is very nice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very nice stay in Marie's flat. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. As the flat is placed on the 5th floor, there's a lot of light, there are lots of plants, a neat little kitchen and a cosy balcony. The apartment is located in a great area, close to the water, green areas/parks, good cafés and public transport. Marie was a very helpful and attentive host. I can definitely recommend to stay in Marie's flat.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Marie's home is a lovely green space, ideally located with a bus stop outside and super market and metro 5 min walk away. Most of Stockholm is 30-50min away depending on your choice of transport.\n\nWe were lucky to have good weather and it was especially lovely to share a wine on the balcony after putting our baby to bed.\n\nA slight issue with cat hair and some allergies is the only reason we couldn't give Marie a perfect 5.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good Location. We took around close to 10minutes walk from the train stop. 15 to 20 minutes walk to Gamla Stan. Elisabeth was very friendly and helpful in providing us with information on where to go. Overall would recommend to stay as the location is very good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We are very excited about our holidays in the house of Elizabeth while the house is situated near the picturesque old city of Stockholm and is also close to subway. It combines both a quiet stay and an easy access to the surrounding streets that are full of life, with snack bar, bistros and bars to go out in the night. The room was very spacious, sunny and clean, classily decorated with Elizabeth’s taste, with a very nice view of Katarina Bangata STR. The breakfast was very rich, and kept us from eating until the evening. But the biggest advantage of all was the hostess, always cheerful and friendly with a good motivation and a tip for the guests. We strongly recommend this house.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth's place is not only nice, Elisabeth herself is a wonderful host. We were really welcome and our little son loved it too.\r\nElisabeth showed us a bit around and had good advices. We had very nice discussions as well and the whole stay was a really peaceful and happy one.\r\nWe would definitely recommend people to book a room there!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth has a room with two single beds, perfect for two friends travelling. It is located in the cool spot of Stockholm, hip Sodermalm. Elisabeth made us a yummy breakfast and gave us good travelling tips! I totally recommend staying with her, it is lovely.\r\nxx</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth added another dimension to our stay in Stockholm with her many stories and insight into both her life and Stockholm. She was a gracious and warm host and her place is neat and full of character.\r\n\r\nThe location of this room is good, situated in the middle of Sodermalm, where there are plenty of trendy restaurants, cafes and bars around, despite the quiet street the flat is actually on. It is a 10 minute walk from Gamla Stan and a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre.\r\n\r\nThe room and bathroom were spacious and is suitable for up to 2 guests. Elisabeth also provided a very nice breakfast. Although the facilities were shared, Elisabeth was very discrete and respected privacy. This place does not have wifi. However, this was not too much of an issue because of the short walking distances around Stockholm. Elisabeth was kind enough to research information about getting around Stockholm, weather etc on our behalf when requested.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend Elisabeth's room for one or two travellers.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Really great experience staying with Elisabeth. Her apartment is clean, big and an unbeatable location. The room is quite comfortable and she is an excellent host, she made a number of suggestions for places to eat, things to see and gave us lots of helpful tips on how to get from a to b. Highly recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We spent a wonderful time at Elisabeth's home. She is such a warmhearted woman and a very caring host. The room was comfortable and clean as well as the bathroom. Elisabeth prepared us a delicious breakfast every morning and gave us always the feeling to be welcome. The localisation of the appartment is perfect: Södermalm is very nice and a good place to start your tour through Stockholm, close to nature as well as to restaurants, cafés and the sights of Stockholm. If you want, Elisabeth gives advices what to see in Stockholm and what you could do during the stay.\r\nWe absolutely recommend you to stay there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything o.k. We had a nice stay. This is a good place to stay at stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Elisabeth a l'art de vous mettre à l'aise avec le sourire. Le quartier où elle vit est très calme et facile d'accès; et il y a de nombreux restaurants et bars à proximité.\r\nOn discute le matin autour d'un excellent petit-déjeuner et Elisabeth peut vous conseiller des visites et des activités intéressantes.\r\nBref, l'adresse est excellente, l'hôtesse aimable et souriante. A recommander!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth has been an ideal host for my parents who really appreciated their stay from the first to the last minute at her place. She is a very friendly person who also happens to be very available and provide good tourism advises. \nThe location of her accommodation is hardly beatable since it is very close from the center in a very cozy district.\nI definitely recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Elisabeth, qui nous a accueilli très chaleureusement. Nous avons pu échanger et Elisabeth nous a très bien renseigné pour les visites. \r\nL'appartement est situé dans un quartier très calme, pourtant central, et proche des transports. Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'atmosphère de ce quartier. \r\nLa chambre était agréable, la salle de bains lumineuse, et les petits déjeuners copieux.\r\nEn bref une très bonne adresse, où nous aimerions retourner.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth was very helpful, friendly and kind. Her apartment is in a great location, near by the center of Stockholm. The room was very comfortable and the price/quality is good. When we go to Stockholm again, we will book again at Elisabeth's place! Thank you Elisabeth!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing week in Stockholm. This was not only because of the beautiful city, but also because of Elisabeth! \r\nShe was incredibly kind, made us a delicious breakfast, and showed us around. We had really nice conversations with her, and she made us feel very much at home. \r\nThe home was also perfect. There was enough space, the beds were good, and the kitchen was also nice!\r\nThe location of the apartment is also good. It's in a neighbourhood with lots of small shops and restaurants. \r\nWe would definitely recommend Elisabeth and her apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth was very helpful in organising our stay.  She replied immediately to all messages.  The room is exactly as advertised (with the tiny exception that the two beds we rearranged to stand next to each other).  The whole flat is perfectly tidy.  The location is great, in a beautiful, very calm alley in the center of the 'hip' area of Stockholm.  Public transport is available within a few minutes' walking distance.  Breakfast was rich and delicious, and provided us a good start into our days.\r\n\r\nElisabeth is a true gem.  Her light-hearted nature and her incredible kindness made a true difference.  If you want to feel at home abroad, hers is the place to go.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Elisabeth was an outstanding host, she is an exuberant,kindhearted person who made us feel welcome and comfortable in her home. Her apartment in Sodermalm is very conveniently located and wonderfully quiet. Security is excellent and there's even a lift (elevator). Her apartment is quite spacious.  She offered us a lovely, healthy breakfast in a large kitchen, always nicely prepared and presented. The metro stop is a short walk, about 3 blocks away. We really enjoyed Sodermalm's restaurants, interesting old neighborhoods, great vintage shops, and of course the rest of Stockholm was delightful as well. Great little bakery called Tartan (Hornsgatan 32) about a 10 minute walk from Elisabeth's. Outstanding skateboard shop nearby, called Kalihula (I think). Really enjoyed Stockholm, 3 days wasn't nearly enough time.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Elisabeth was an awesome host! We arrived pretty late in the evening and she had no problem waiting for us and chatting for a while well past midnight. The room was spacious and welcoming (more lovely than the photos might suggest), with a nice view over Stockholm's coolest neighborhood. Just a few blocks away you'll find hip design shops, delicious cinnamon buns...and the rest of the city is easily walkable. Elisabeth made us feel so welcome, and we spent long mornings enjoying the spectacular breakfast spread she prepared and sharing stories - she has an amazing energy that's easy to get caught up with! A wonderful introduction to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth is a welcoming host who worked hard to make my experience comfortable and special. The neighbourhood is quiet, full of good restaurants, and within walking distance of many sites (or an easy walk to public transit if you prefer). I was happy to stay there both during the conference I attended, and afterwards while enjoying the city.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Absolutely fantastic. Elisabeth is a fantastic, lively and amazing host who would recommend you the best walks to get to know the city, not to mention the great lengths she goes to take care of you: we had to leave early and she didn't have the time to prepare us the AMAZING gorgeous breakfast she prepared the first two (Website hidden by Airbnb) she packed some OJ, sandwiches and bananas for the plane. Just astonishing.\n\nThanks a million Elisabeth, hoep to see you in Tenerife!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Please add us to the list of those with many kudos for Elisabeth - she's warm, engaging, cultured and will tell you all the best places to visit in stunning Stockholm.  We enjoyed the spacious, quiet bedroom and fantastic breakfasts.  And it was nice to have an elevator.  There's one bathroom with a bath and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose, but it's also spacious and there was never a problem sharing.  The T-bana (Metro) is nearby (0.6 km) but we enjoyed the pretty walk to the Royal Palace (2.2 km) and downtown (2.8 km) areas.  It's an expensive city so check out the lunch specials during the work week and invest in the Stockholm Pass if you like museums (there are many good ones) and boat trips.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Location:\nExcellent! Many restaurants and bars. Very close to the subway station. \n\nApartment:\nJust wonderful. The bedroom is quaint and the bed is amazingly comfortable. The bathroom is huge and has great lighting. I love Elisabeth's rock and driftwood collection! Our collections would get along. Breakfasts were darling. \n\nHost: \nElisabeth is one of those people everyone needs to meet. She is beyond interesting. We learned so much about Stockholm and its people. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I booked accommodation for my mother and her friend with Elisabeth. While I can confidently say that they had an amazing time staying with Elisabeth, this review is from them...\n\nElisabeth greeted us with a huge smile and lots of energy. She continued to be a happy and fun host for the duration of our week-long stay. The breakfast each morning was fabulous and if we behaved ourselves we were treated with a chocolate =). \n\nThe location was perfect. Right in the middle of Sodermalm, yet down a quiet and very safe feeling street. The train station was only a short walk through the heart of the city.\n\nThe room was spacious and comfortable with towels and linen provided.\n\nThank you very much Elisabeth for making us feel so welcome in your home and city. You made our experience much more fun than staying elsewhere. \n\nBe sure to comment on the light shade in the kitchen during your stay with Elisabeth and watch her face light up!\n\nWe can not recommend Elisabeth and her AirBnB highly enough.\n\nMany thanks,\nLinda and Sue</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed three nights  at Elisabeth's cozy home and felt  very much welcomed. Beside the delicious breakfast and enjoyable talks we got  a lot of good tips how to spend the time in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth is a great host who went the extra mile to make sure we had a good time in the city she loves. Left\nPerfect for my first time in Stockholm, she was very helpful and her place is in a great location to access most anything you'd want to see while still being quiet and comfortable. Strongly recommend</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice cosy room,  great chats with Elisabeth, wonderful breakfast and excellent central location. When I return to Sweden I shall definitely book again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Elisabeth is a really good person, her happiness is contagious and we enjoyed staying by her.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Impression - Great host, Large clean all white well furnished room, great location with 5 minutes walk of T-Bana and within a few stops of city center, great neighborhood with many cool cafes and restaurants nearby.\r\nThe Host - Satya is a great host with relaxed vibe, always helpful and provide good information without being too intrusive.\r\nThe Place - The room is large, white-washed, and well furnished with plenty of open space. We have a share of clean bathroom (good water flow / warm) and kitchen. The room also come with good wifi connection. And of course, you will notice plenty of \"\"happy man\"\" right from the front door of Satya's flat.\r</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice room! The appartement has a really good situation, in a nice neighbourhood just next to the center.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I was here for a whole month and definitely recommend this place! The apartment is very nice, with a large room with good light. Very homely, filled with different artworks and with a good bathroom and kitchen. Lovely area, close to the T-bana and busses so it is convenient to get almost anywhere! There are also grocery stores, cafes, restaurants etc. within a couple of minutes of the apartment. Satya is a great host; very relaxed and happy to talk or leave you to yourself. Very happy to have met him, we had some good conversations :) He was also nice enough to extend my stay a few days at short notice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fredric made me feel very welcome, he can be good to talk to but also allows you your own space which is also nice.  He keeps the apartment clean and tidy.  The bedroom is big and spacious with a comfortable bed.  The best thing about this apartment is the location, it is walking within walking distance to most things and very close to a main T-bana (underground), train line and airport bus stop.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a very good time at Fredric's place. He's a very easy-going and nice person who respects your privacy. His apartment is in a great spot, very convenient for people working at KI. It is bright with a super comfy bed and has this very calming vibe to it. Fredric gave me lots of helpful advice (cheapest supermarket, best yoga studio) and also let me use his kitchen and washing machine.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fredric was a great host for my girlfriend and I, and has a lovely apartment in a great area just north of Kungsholmen in Stockholm. There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fredric is a friendly, responsive and generous host. He always offers me tips to make my stay easier and it was such a pleasure talking with him. The apartment is beautiful, clean and minimalistic. There are most of the standard equipment there. The room is spacious, bright and the bed is comfortable too. The location is also very good: metro station, supermarkets, bakery shop, restaurants etc all in 5 mins walking distance, 10mins metro ride to the center of the city. I really recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What a gem! Both the place and Fredric are just lovely. Had the best stay and felt like home. The location and value are amazing. Really cool place with an extra arty and soul touch  Will be back soon and defo booking the same place! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had really good time at Frederic’s place! Frederic was friendly and funny so I had a good time chatting with him. And, the room was very spacious and clean. Also, his place was very well equipped so everything was convenient for long-term stay!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Frederic is a great host, I felt welcome right away. The apartment is very nice, with great artwork all around. I also really enjoyed the nice neighborhood with lots of good restaurants.  I hope to be back in Stockholm some day and would definitely stay at Frederic's place again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fredric is a quiet but passionate person, who has a lot of interesting stories to tell.  A simple yet efficient apartment for a good price. I've enjoyed my stay a lot</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mia is an excellent host, and we all three ladies would gladly recommed her place for a stayover in Stockholm. Her apartment was nice and neat, and Mia provided all the stuff you could imagine needing over a weekend-stay in Stockholm. The location is perfect for taking the bus from/to the Arlanda airport and close to Odenplan metro station (just few stops from major attractions). Most importantly Mia is great, and she provided us local tips what to do; bet Drottningatan easily:) \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Mia for a fun stay!\r\n\r\nBR: R, R and Y</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This host of ours was very kind in a lot of regards, so we got a lot of support to get things done - like finding the right place to go to for new years eve. It was also a pleasure to take aperifivs with her friends - always nice to meet lokals like this!\r\n\r\nRegarding the appartment it was great to stay at a place where you can easely reach the very hotspot of the city (which is sturehof) within 5min by bus and have very good connections to the T-bana (metro), which will bring you everywhere - including Södermalm, where we were having a good bar trip with Lasse, Mia's friend (thanks again for that!)\r\nSo for visitors like us, who like to see a lot of different thinks, it was great.\r\nThe area itself also has a lot to offer, many different shops nearby, like a supermarket 2min away and a delicious bakery for example!\r\n\r\nNot to be missed_ Thank you Mia : )\r\n\r\nArrivederci!

Thaks Mia for everything, we appreciated.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mia was an amazing host, her apartment is very nice, clean, well equiped,  and very close to the Odenplan metro station and city center.

Aurore and Bruno.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"My teenage daughter and I had a great time in \"\"casa Mia\"\". The apartment is just what you need for a good stay in beautiful Stockholm - both for business and vacation. It´s cosy</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia's apartment is super centrally located close to everything you could possibly need/want during your stay. Despite being in the middle of everything the apartment is as quiet as being out in the woods; you will sleep very soundly! Mia is a very helpful and knowledgeable host and was full of tips and good advice. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated in whites and blues. The internet speed was plenty to support 2 simultaneous (Hidden by Airbnb) calls at great quality. The shower had amazingly high pressure and we were sad to leave it behind!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia's flat is a a real gem in the heart of Stockholm!  It is in a charming building from 1899. Despite being in a vibrant quarter of Stockholm, it is very quiet and peaceful. \r\n\r\nThe metro (tunnelbana) stop is just two minutes away or you can walk to the city centre, which takes around 15 minutes. There are a couple of super-markets close by in case you are spending several days and want to cook for yourselves. \r\n\r\nIf you want to eat out, there is plenty of choice. Try the newly opened Kin Maru restaurant just round their corner. Their vegetarian bibimbap is very good. \r\n\r\nAh and if you are fan of Pippi Longstocking, then you are in for a treat because the house where Astrid Lindgren lived for 60 years is just around the corner. \r\n\r\nWe plan to stay here the next time we visit Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>we had a lovely stay in Mia's cosy apartment. She was SO helpful and such a good communicator. She is a lovely generous spirit. Her apartment had everything we needed and it was close to the trains and a nice walk into the main part of Stockholm. A supermarket close by as well made it very easy for us. A lovely experience in a lovely city.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was my first trip using this website and if my stay at Mia's was indicative of how subsequent trips will be, I am a traveler with AirBnB for life!  Her apartment was clean, had excellent access to public transport, and most importantly was a great central location to downtown Stockholm.  I found that people like to walk in that city, and the location was great for that as well.  The bus from the airport stops just a block away from her place, there is a grocery store within a few hundred yards, and a beautiful park just across the street.  She was timely in returning my emails before the trip and very easy to work with.  I highly recommend using Mia's apartment for anyone spending any time in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment is in an excellent location, a few blocks from the airport bus stop, two minutes' walk from a subway station and supermarket, and an easy walk to the center of Stockholm.  Vasaparken, with its ice-skating rink, is just across the street, so if you have your own skates you can nip over for a bit of skating before or after your day's activities.  The Hagaparken, with its walking paths, is also quite close.  The apartment faces the courtyard, not the street, so it is very quiet.  It is also very well heated.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was well equipped, the sofa in the living room is very comfortable, and the apartment was very clean and nicer than the pictures.  Mia was very friendly, greeted us exactly as arranged, and gave us a short tour of the neighborhood.  She has a collection of guidebooks and maps of the city in the apartment, and she provided two Access cards for public transport (Stockholm's equivalent of Oyster cards) for our use, which was very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe bed is very soft, which is great for some people and uncomfortable for others.  I can recommend Mia and her apartment highly.\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mia was an excellent host. She was friendly and helpful and her apartment was really nice and convenient (located in a very beautiful part of Stockholm). Would highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything was perfect at Mia's place! She was so friendly and she helped us spontaneously! \nThe apartment was clean and cozy especially for a couple! \nThe location is also good we did everything by foot and the street was safe and really nice \n\nThanks again Mia </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mia is amazing, a born-host. Very welcoming, I felt great as soon as I entered the flat until when I left. The flat is perfectly located, close to everything and with lots of restaurant. I'm booking again when I'm back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia has a lovely flat in a very good location, very close to restaurants and bars. Her flat is ideal for two people and offers enough space.\n\nThe checkin and check out went all smoothly.\n\nWould Liem to stay again</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mia's communication was excellent and very helpful. The apartment was as described in a vibrant part of Stockholm with very easy transport options. Mia has lots of information about what to do and where to go in Stockholm. Highly recommend</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mia is great host, and an amazing person. Stayed one night in her apartment, got in late and delayed, never complained but instead had a drink with me in her local/bar restaurant which has an amazing history. One of the oldest in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia was a wonderful host and her home was perfect for the week for me and my colleague. Her house was at a walking distance from the city centre and all the hustle bustle. The neighborhood was fantastic with a couple of good cozy coffee shops and restaurants. Mia was very responsive to our requests and also gave some great tips on how to get about the city.All in all it was a good experience.. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia is a good host. We manage to agree for accommodation of our employee only a day prior to arrival. Very easy to communicate with. Her apartment is a good location, near city center. Place itself is great, as described on the profile. We recommend this apartment to others. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mia is an amazing host, and she made Stockholm feel friendly from the very beginning! We loved our stay in her apartment-- good location, and easy to walk to from the central station, if you like walking. We never used public transportation during our stay, and were delighted by the availability of coffee shops, grocery stores, and antique stores in the area. The apartment itself is in a very secure building, with a well-stocked kitchen for basic cooking, and the extra bed is actually extremely comfortable, even though it's a fold-up one! Mia left us hot chocolate when the weather turned cold, was kind enough to help me by actually taking care of my laundry for me, and was extremely understanding when we had to arrive a day late, even though she didn't get our message in time. All in all, our stay in Stockholm was amazing, and we highly recommend Mia's place! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mia is really nice and welcomed us herself. She had some basic food items (coffee, cookies, etc) for us, which was really thoughtful. The apartment is big, spacious, and gets good light. It's also got a nice TV and Netflix. Location wise, it is very close to the subway, in a really nice part of town, and walking distance to pretty much everything, when the weather's nice. The bed is a bit small for two people, but it's manageable. Overall, a great experience!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is a fantastic apartment in a fantastic location with a fantastic host. While Mia wasn't in town during my and my friend's stay, she did an amazing job of staying in touch, coordinating, and providing helpful tips throughout our visit. She's incredibly thoughtful and responsive. Not to mention that the apartment is perfect for two travelers and is nice and quiet, as it is set back from the street. It is a very well-appointed apartment and has a good, functional kitchen if you've had a long (and maybe cold) day of touring around and would prefer a warm, relaxed night in cooking your own dinner. Vasastan is a vibrant neighborhood with many restaurants, coffeehouse, and bar options, though the apartment is convenient for those interested in Gamla Stan or Soldermalm too, given that the quick and efficient subway system is just a few steps away. Stockholm is a lovely city and this is the perfect apartment from which to explore it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lovely host and ideal location for Sodermalm as well as getting to the exhibition centre where I was working. Lidia gave me the double room as it was available which was perfect, but this single room looked just as good. Tasty, filling breakfast. Wifi worked great too. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a base to explore Stockholm</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is amazing! Her apartment is very well appointed and in an excellent location. She is a fabulous host, she goes out of her way to help provide information on Stockholm and goes that extra mile to make guests comfortable. \r\nIf I get the chance to come back to Stockholm I would stay with Lidia again! Oh, and you MUST try her breakfasts- they're fantastic!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is amazing, I had a wonderful stay, she will take good care of you. Recommend wholeheartedly!!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia's apartment is perfectly located, central and at the same time in quite district, everything what tourist might need is close by. Apartment is clean, neat and cosy. Bed is fantastic....But the main beauty of this apartment is its hostess - Lidia. She is amazing, wonderful and welcoming lady who tells you much more than is written in any book or web about Stockholm and Sweden in general.\r\n\r\nI 100% recommend Lidia's B&B, as missing this opportunity to get to know Lidia means that you've just passed by the Stockholm.\r\n\r\nP.S. Her breakfasts are just separate phenomenon, that shouldn't be missed. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I spent 5 wonderful days in Stockholm, staying at Lidia's! She's a great host, very welcoming and friendly. She gave me a lot of useful information about Stockholm, what to see and what to, when to go and how to get there. And she prepares an excellent breakfast !  I loved our chats over breakfast and in the evening, it really added this little extra to my holiday. Recommended !\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I thought this was great! Lidia was very sweet and helpful, while also respectful of privacy, etc. House, bed, and bathroom were all very clean and comfortable, especially compared to some other European hotels of similar price range! Wifi worked like a charm. Location is good too-- I walked pretty much everywhere (and I mean everywhere), but it was also easy to hop on the train or a bus.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had an amazing time with Lidia. She is very kind and very helpful, I enjoyed my stay very much. The room is spacious with a big window and very clean, you can find all the things you need! Although it was a shared-bathroom I had no problem at all! Lidia is a very sweet lady, the breakfasts were so good (with lots of food!). If I come back to Stockholm in the future I will definitely stay at Lidia's place again. \r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia was really wonderful.  She was very helpful telling me about good things to see in Stockholm and giving me tips on how to save some money.  Her directions from the airport to her house were very good.  Her apartment is easy to get to from the airport.  You get on a commuter train and the stop is a five minute walk to her apartment.  After my check-out time was past, she really showed her true colors helping me above and beyond the call of duty.  I am most appreciative for her help at that time.  Her apartment is perfectly set up for guests with rooms on a second floor.  I highly recommend Lidia!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is an amazing host and she has an excellent and quiet apartment blocks from the trendy Södermalm (aka Söder) area.  Upon arrival, she offered me coffee, a map and some wonderful information on places to visit and things to see.  The bedrooms are on the 2nd floor of the duplex that also has a separate bathroom and seating room.  Lidia pretty much stays on the 1st floor and I had the privacy of the 2nd floor to myself.  \n\nI highly recommend Lidia's apartment and I plan on coming back with my friends to stay with her.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The stay at Lidia's was most comfortable. The street and area in general are very quiet and friendly for walking around. The location is perfect from commuter train, also from subway although slightly further.There are some buses around the corner but I did not use them.\r\nThe flat itself is spacious and luminous, very clean and with all commodities well set up. I stayed in a single room which provided an extremely cozy bed and direct sunlight in the morning. Storage space was also more than sufficient. The bathroom is very spacious and clean too. .\r\nThe fact that the guest rooms are one floor above from homeowner gives a good sense of privacy. Besides, each room comes with a key to have it locked. Still, meeting Lidia in the kitchen is a wonderful time to spend, she is most helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to transport, visiting the city and touring around. She really is a wonderful host, I will definitely keep her in my list when I visit Stockholm next time. Thank you Lidia for all your kind help!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was amazing to stay with Lidia. She is very kind and sweet lady. We had very nice discussions during the evenings and at breakfast tables. She inspired me to visit nice places in Stockholm besides my work. Her apartment was very nice and cozy. If you want to live in home outside your home, Lidia's place is just the perfectt choice.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Excellent. Great value for money. Lidia is a great host, very friendly and helpful. The place was comfortable with nice decoration giving it overall a nice and cosy feel. Very convenient location with excellent public transport services.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I definately recommend Lidias place as a perfect place to stay in your Stockolm visit.  Its conveniently located close to everything withbwonderful communications near by.  My room was neat, clean, spacious and had wonderful light.  I slept woderfully, with quiteness and comfort.  The showe is excellent, abundant hot water, great after a long day of walking.  I felt pretty much at home, Lidia made me feel immediately welcomed, helped me with asertive suggestions of ways and places ti visit, her daily opinions helped me to make the best of my time in this fantastic city.  Her breakfast was delicious, in a cozy luminious table, with everything so esquisitely arranged and presented.  i can still taste those crunchy croissants, perfect way to start a busy day!!! Those tastybcheeses, hams and salamis!!! Fruit, eggs, everything!! Thank you Lidia!!!

Thank you Lidia for making my stay 5 stars in all ways,!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>For not being right in the middle of Gamla Stan, an easy to reach and central location in Stockholm. Less then five minutes from the train station, less then ten minutes from the nearest metro.\r\n\r\nLidia is a great host and the views from the room are pretty darn excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>It was amazing experience with Lidia, I stayed with her three times and every time she is very kind and generous with a warm welcome. I definitely stay with her again and recommend her place for visitors to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I spent lovely 5 days in Stockholm, and that's only partially due to the great weather I encountered - the other reason is that Lidia is a great host with a great space right in the middle of Södermalm. Transportation is convenient, the flat has a great view, decently sized rooms, plenty of other space and good amenities. Lidia is an excellent host: super friendly, very keen on making sure her guests feel instantly at home...somehow there always seems to have a cup of coffee or tea ready :) So thanks for the great time, I do plan to be back and I recommend very much to anybody intending to travel to STO to see if there's a room available at Lidia's.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia was an excellent host.

I'd love to go back soon.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is located in a quiet part of Södermalm and very accessible to the public transport, near to the train and metro, but also near to Sofo, the area of this island full of restaurants and good atmosphere.\r\nLidia prepared us nices breakfasts in the morning and gave us great tips for visiting. She was pleasant, well informed about Stockholm and talkative in general culture, so we had really good conversations.\r\nVery comfortable accommodations, with a nice common room for the guests. Highly recommended. I felt like home and enjoyed the city a lot. Thanks!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed two weeks in May in Lydia's airB&B when I was in Stockholm for work. The description was accurate. I stayed in the single room. It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia has been an extremely wonderful host. Very polite, friendly and gives a very warm welcome when you arrive. Details provided to the address was more than sufficient in navigating to the apartment. Apartment has a very cozy feeling and the room directly faces an open park with a good view of the outside and plenty of ventilation. Apartment is also located close to some of the neighbourhood's most beautiful viewing points of Stockholm up at Mariatorget. If you are intending to visit Stockholm and want somewhere nice and cozy to stay in Sodermalm, do consider staying with Lidia!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is a fantastic host. She helps you solve anything you may need. The room is great, very luminous because of the huge window it has. Moreover the views are amazing. Everything is clean and comfortable. If I came back to Stockholm, i would definately stay here again. Location is great too.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia was a most welcoming host. I felt at home right away. She was full of information and good advice.  Her apartment is big, whith all the ammenities necessary and full of light. It is in a great location, close to restaurants and public transportation to everywhere in town.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia was an amazing host, very helpful with information, what is the easiest, what is the cheapest. Always there for you, but never intrusive, I Will definitely recommend! :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room was as good as I had expected and Lidia as nice as I had hoped. The location is great, it is very easy to get into town, only a few minutes away from public transport and close enough to the center to walk there. It is quiet at night and I felt like coming home after long days walking around Stockholm. \r\nHaving read previous reviews, I also decided to book breakfast which was a good idea.\r\nIt was my first airbnb-experience but hopefully not my last and should I come back to Stockholm, I am sure to try and stay with Lidia again. It is great to be able to travel this way as a 60+ person and also great to have a 60+ host as welcoming and interesting as Lidia. Thanks a lot, Lidia.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia was a very good host and nice lady.  She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  \r\n\r\nThe room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   \r\n\r\nThere were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  \r\n\r\nIt is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.\r\n\r\nLidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter).  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.\r\n\r\nGiven another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>First of all want to say that I  couldn't really believe in comments here until I saw it with my eyes and thank you all lovely people here for honest reviews ! \n The room looked like exactly the way it looks like on the pictures!  Everything was very tidy, clean, very nice atmosphere and quiet. No motorbike noises by night from the street  ( was very important to me.. ) One has really  everything for relaxing there.

I had never used bus in Sthlm and she was super helpfull whenever I needed tips about local traffic and other stuff. \n\nRooms were very cozy and you get a key to your own so it's totally safe as well - even though there might ne other ppl staying there as well. \n\nSimply excellent experience. Would totally recommend and go again! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Lidia was an amazing host, and has a beautiful home.

And the breakfasts were delicious!  She was also located in a very convenient part of Stockholm, easily accessible to the majority of the city. I would recommend staying with Lidia to anyone! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia was very welcoming. She took the time to explain to me what sites I should see and what are the best places in the town. I felt very welcome. The room was very good and excellently equipped. The bathroom is great and very clean. The apartment is very neat and nicely decorated. The closest commuter train station is minutes away, while the closest metro station is about 10 minutes away on foot. The location is quiet, but close to the center of Södermalm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed 6 days at Lidias in May 2016. Actually I did´t get the single room that was shown in the advertisement even if I booked the room about 9 months ago.  But it didn´t matter. It mattered more that Lidia was so kind and helpful. She gave me a lot of information and good suggestions how to come around in Stockholm. As my cable for to charge my mobil phone didn´t work she borrowed me her cable for the time I stayed there. So I was able to take the photos and keep in contact with my family and friends. I was even able to practise my swedish with her. She was really a patient person to listen to me and to talk swedish with me even if I did not speak it so well. She had during my visit also some other guests staying there and they were also very nice. I enjoeyd the conversation with Lidia and her guests. It was so nice to stay in her flat,  I feld like home! I recommend Lidia and her flat for everybody who would stay a while in Stockholm.   </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia was a terrific host. She provided excellent directions to her place from the airport, including options for the fastest vs cheapest routes. After getting to her place, she made coffee and croissants, and oriented me with the neighborhood and Stockholm. The room was clean, cozy and had a lovely view. She was great communicating and just a pleasure to deal with. I heartily recommend Lidia, and will definitely stay at her place again on my next visit to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lidia is so lovely and kind, a great resource of excellent information about the city and very attentive to your comfort. I'd highly recommend! The location is ideal, with easy access to all the cool spots Sodermalm has to offer, plus proximity to public transport to easily reach city highlights that are further away. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is amazingly great host! She helped me a lot, charming and also tolerant of the other culture.\r\nI had stayed here for more than 3 weeks and spent many hours with her and talked a lot.\r\nFridge, kettle, coffee…everything you need for travel is here. And Lidia allowed me to use laundry too.\r\nThe location is perfect for sightseeing in Stockholm. It’s very convenience to get to the center of Stockholm and also SOFO area. But so quiet.\r\nClose to the subway station and bus station, too. There are many nice cafes around here.\r\nI came to Stockholm for studying Swedish, the room was so comfortable to study.

Overall, i would highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.\r\n\r\nMy parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.\r\n\r\nMy single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.\r\n\r\nI really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.\r\n\r\nLidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lidia is truly an amazing host and she is at the top of the list for host I have had so far with Airbnb. She made me feel right at home and is very sweet. She was kind enough to sit down with me when I arrived and walked me through ways to get around the city and main spits to check out. Her place was in a perfect location and was comfortable and clean. I think you'll appreciate Lidi's cheery disposition and her great apartment, if you stay with her. Many thanks to Lidia for making my stay in Stockholm a memorable one. :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The appartment is very easy to reach and Lidia had good tips how to get there for less money. The room was clean, but the bathroom could have been cleaner (maybe because more guests are using it).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I have great time in Lidia's home. She is very helpful and kind lady. She always tries to help you, if you need anything. Her home is big and comfortable. She always tried to make myself at home. Also it was really nice to talk with her. She is very friendly. Her home has great location, lots of good cafes in there and also close to city center.I recommend this to everyone who is visiting the beautiful city, Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I was in Stockholm for a conference and some sightseeing and Lidia's place was perfect for this.  Lidia was a fantastic host and communication was excellent. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lidia is absolutely incredible - the sweetest and most helpful person ever! I truly love my stay at her place! \n\nThe bed is comfy. The room is adequate. And the bathroom is clean! \n\nLidia also spent a good 30 minutes with me giving me suggestions of places to go and planning he route since I only had one day in Stockholm! She also helped me with a train ticket by calling SJ and having them send it to me electronically! She cares about her guests and helps them in any way she can!\n\nAlways offered tea and coffee, and even made me breakfast in the morning!!\n\nAll in all, stay with Lidia. You won't regret it!!\n\nThe place is also central. Easy to get anywhere in Stockholm from her place!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had a great stay here and would definitely recommend it. Everything is exactly as described and seen in the pictures. Lidia is wonderful and incredibly helpful. She gave me excellent directions for arriving from the airport (including different options) and great recommendations for my stay in Stockholm. The room and common areas were very clean. I had a very enjoyable stay at Lidia's and would definitely stay there again should I find myself back in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li is an excellent host, I received a lot of Stockholm sightseeing info from her. And she shows her caring through out my stay which made me felt like home. Her house is cozy and warm, the place can make you easily relax after a whole day travel.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li was an excellent host- very nice and helpful. Great location next to train station- super easy to get around. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Idéalement situé à proximité des transports en communs, l'ensemble des quartiers de la ville sont rapidement accessible depuis le logement de Li. Son accueil est très chaleureux, la chambre fonctionnelle et toutes les commodités sont à disposition (micro-ondes, réfrigérateur, vaisselle). J'ai beaucoup apprécié de discuter avec Li, elle m'a efficacement donné toutes les informations utiles, et donné d'excellentes explications sur la ville. Je ne peux que recommander de la rencontrer.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Li was an amazing host! She provided me with so much information on transportation, museums, sights to see and things to do in Stockholm. The bed was super comfy and clean. Staying at her was place was very pleasant. It is centrally located and easy to get around. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had a wonderful experience staying with Li! She has a beautiful home in an excellent location. Upon my arrival Li greeted me with a warm cup of tea and a map of Stockholm where she gave me an overview of places to visit and see. The room was just as advertised: clean, warm, spacious (I'm from NY, everything seems big) and a solid WiFi signal. I'd definitely stay with Li again if I travel to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li’s Place is wonderful - clean, spacious, light, airy, and secure. The location in the Södermalm district is close to three transit stations and many bus lines. Several excellent bakeries and coffee houses lie within a 5-minute walk - you can even walk to Gamla Stan (the Old Town area) if you want. Li is friendly and helpful and a joy to talk with, making you feel right at home. Will definitely be my first choice when heading back to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li's place is definitely a gem in Stockholm. It is in the central location, with convenient transportation to every place of interest. The room is lovely and clean with everything you need for a short trip.  Li is a super good host, who would recommend your trip carefully and patiently. She also lent an umbrella and an adapter to me. I would recommend it to every traveller if you plan to visit Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Linda is such a lovely person. She provided me with amazing tips for the city and I followed her guide to the letter. The location was great and it was everything as expected. Such a great time.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li is so sweet and helpful.  Her place is at an excellent location next to the train station.  I had a wonderful time staying at her apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Linda is lovely and her place was nice. A little tricky to find, although she gave good instructions. And whilst Stockholm has terrific public transport, you're not quite in the heart of it all.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>all good</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li is a very friendly host who has  great knowledge about sights and attractions. Her tips are very helpful. Her place is located in a very convenient area. Close to both the Commuter Train station and subway station. The neighborhood is very nice and idyllic. The check-in was super easy. The rooms in her place are absolutely superb for their prices. The whole apartment feels well organized and cozy. The room has nice decorations and the linens are always nice and clean. Her apartment has a very good laundry room but you will need her help to gain access to the laundry room. Overall Li’s place is probably one of the best places I have stayed and I definitely will recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit  the busy Stockholm but also wants to stay at a quite and nice place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location, very nice place and excellent host!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The host is very kind and wants to help you if needed. After a warm welcome, she gives you advices about the city, places you can visit, what can you do etc. Rooms are great, everything is as written in the offer.. The location is just perfect, in the center, and good for arranging any kind of sightseeing very easily.. Warm recommendations for this host and accommodation, as well!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Staying at Li’s place was amazing! It feels very homely and is very near the train station. She gave me lots of tips on what to visit and was very accommodating!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Had an amazing stay at Li’s place! Quiet and central location and clean place. I felt very welcome. She showed me the map and good places to visit. We had very nice chats and she even offered me tea and a a pastry when I arrived!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Li is an amazing and gracious host. Accommodated a really late check in , had all tourist info handy and was ever willing to help. Place was cozy and convenient to get around by public transport. Would definitely visit again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Li est une excellente hôtesse, généreuse et qui fournit beaucoup d'explications et de documentation sur Stockholm qu'elle connaît très bien. Arrivée très tôt le matin elle m'a accueillie avec un petit déjeuner complet! Le logement est très confortable, lumineux, avec  beaucoup d'équipements, très bien situé: à 2mn à pied de la gare de Sodra: difficile de mieux faire! Je recommande l'hospitalité de Li!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The place is super clean, and right at the center of the city. The host, Li, is an amazing lady who has made my stay in Stockholm so much fun! She is friendly, reachable and has a lot of information about the place. She is no doubt a super host!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Li is an amazing host. She will make you feel at home and also give you your privacy. I highly recommend staying here if you plan to explore Stockholm. It is in a great location, very close to public transportation. And if you have any questions, Li has your back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Li was a great host. On arrival, she showed me some maps of the city and explained how to get to key locations (including the cheapest way to the airport). She has lived in the area for a long time and I could ask her about things I saw as I was exploring.\n\nThe house is comfortable and I felt like I had a lot of privacy and space to myself. However the bathroom and guest lounge are shared with other guests so you might have to wait to use the shower etc.\n\nIt's in a good location, very near a subway station and you can walk to a lot of interesting places too.\n\nHighly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I highly recommend Marcello. he is an excellent host, since  I arrived until the minute I left, he was very helpful and always trying to make a  memorable time in Stockholm. He pretty much provided with everything I needed; tips where to go in the city, computer, even a cell phone. Definitively it went beyond my expectations. Last day he made a great farewell lunch. No better place to stay while in Stockholm. He will make you feel\r\nlike at home away from home.\r\n\r\nThanks Marcello</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Marcelo is a very nice and easy going guy. The room is good, and was everything I needed. There is also a major shopping centre and train station just a short walk away from the apartment. All in all I think it's a nice place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Half of the room's walls are glass windows, both looking outside of the building and in the living room. These glass walls are covered with some tents, that's the privacy level the room enables. \r\nThe real problem is actually having good sleep, as sun rises very early in the morning. Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.\r\nThe room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. \r\nI don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I enjoyed my stay at Marcelo's apartment.. He was very friendly and helpful and made me feel welcome from the start. The apartment is very clean and neat, and the facilities are excellent. The apartment is well situated, only about 5 min walk from a great shopping mall (with a good food court)  and the train and bus station.\r\n\r\nI would recommend Marcelo as a host and would stay there anytime in future if I get the chance.\r\n\r\nJC</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Marcelo is very friendly and hospitable. He even allowed me to have an ethernet cable running through his living room so i could have internet access. The park right behind the room is just amazing. You can take walk trails through the woods and pick up berries. \r\nThe room is relatively small but it was just what i needed for that small period of time. Thanks Marcelo!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>l'accueil par notre hôte a été excellent. L'appartement est très agréable, très propre et très fonctionnel.\r\nlieu très accessible en métro depuis le centre de Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I rented this location for a month but only stayed two weeks due to travelling but it was a good experience. The area is very quiet and close to the mall and metro station.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed here for 2 months. My stay was better than expected. Communication with Marcelo is easy. Before I came I was worries that room would be cold because it is mostly windows but I was wrong. Room was nicely warm even though there was snow outside. Marcelo kept apartment really clean. Location is superb - only few minutes walk to metro station, buss station and nearest shopping center. I can highly recommend. Compared to other listings in Stockholm this was good quality for the money.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Marcelo is a wonderful host. He is very professional with allocating the space you need for your groceries, laundry, trash, etc. and labeling them. It makes you feel very comfortable. The room isn't big but's it's perfectly reasonable for a single tennant. I's right as pictured, with a wardrobe and studying table. The lighting is very good, many different lamps and the room gets good amount of sunlight. Since it's ground level it's easy to access. It's located very good as well, one bus stop or 6 minutes walk from Kinsta centrum, where there's subway and all the stuff you need; great shopping center. From there you can go to city center or anywhere else you want thrpugh public transport. There's also a park nearby the house. Good location, great host, perfectly clean and tidy house... Definitely recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Staying at Linnea appartment in Farsta Strand was perfect for me visting\r\nStockholm. Train/Tube connection is very well and Linnea's appartment is\r\nspacious and nice, I enjoyed it. Linnea is a very friendly and concerned host, and this from the first contact immediately after reservation until leaving. Also I tried Linnea's bars session which have been for me an amazing experience. Strongly recommended!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Linnéa was great!  Very good host.  The location was great just like everyone mentioned.  Metro was super close and it was convenient to have a Coop store (groceries, etc) that is open til 2200.  \r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend Linnéa if you plan on staying in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Linnéa is a great host, really open minded and it is always fun to speak with. She is an amazing person. \r\n\r\nHer place is very near to the subway and it taxes less than 25 minutes to reach the central station and Gamla Stan (historical island).\r\n\r\nYou will enjoy your stay here! Thank you again for your nice being Linnéa :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Linnéa  is a fantastic host and amazing person! It was so wonderful to live with her. We laughed so much, she helped me a lot, and I felt like living at my house! Subway and Coop are really close. Only few minutes!\r\nThe best of all is that i I got a new friend!!!\r\nTack så jätte mycket Linnéa!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything was great. I would recommend this place to anyone who said they are going to Stockholm. Unfortunately Linnea was not there herself but Enrico was there and he took good care as a host.  </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Linnéa, a great soul, offered me to stay at her place.\r\nShe is trustful, her home so clean and beautiful, she coordinated me determined thru the airbnb ware-fare. I've got the chance to meet her great friends and had definitely an amazing time! Hope to meet you one day (again - what?)!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I enjoyed my stay very much.Aalthough I didn't meet Linnea.,she was very helpful via email and her flatmate, Enrico, took very good care of me. The room was spacious and comfortable. I would clarify that the 16 minutes to the city center refers only to the time on the train. You have to walk 5 minutes to the station and if you miss a train, as I did, you may have to wait about 10 minutes for the next. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Linnea was an excellent host - we stayed with her for 3 nights during the first part of our trip in Sweden. Both Linnea and her house mates were very friendly and welcoming and the house was a calm and wholesome place to be. Lake and woodland very close by as well as direct transport links to the buzzing city centre. Linnea kept in frequent contact prior to our trip which enabled us to find the house very easily. We'd definitely recommend her!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We stayed 3 nights during our stay in Stockholm.\r\nLocation is nice and quiet and very easy to get to the city from the apartment, everyone was very helpful when navigating public transport :)\r\nLinnea was a great host and made sure we had coffee and breakfast for our mornings before we would start our day.\r\nThe bed was amazingly comfortable and we both slept very well during our stay!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Linnea was an excellent host.  I really enjoyed my time in Stockholm because of her help and concern.  She is delightful and very talented in so many ways.  I would recommend her to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I enjoyed staying at Linnéa's home. She was very kind and her house was as described in her listing. It was a good location for exploring the city of Stockholm and the surrounding areas.  I slept very well there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice young family with cute baby!  The house is situated away from the city as the listing says, but it is quite easy to go back and forth from the city, takes literally 30mins including the walk from metro/train. Linnéa lent me the spare transport card so i could top up with the 24 hours pass and that was convenient.\n\nThe walk up is easy but if you are arriving with a big luggage like me in winter time, be prepared for some pushing and rolling.\n\nI didnt see much of Linnéa as she was away with baby, but her bf Arnando took good care of me and even bought breakfast items for me. They even recommended coffee spots for me as i am a coffee hunter, and all the suggestions were great!\n\nHouse and room is big and surely enough space for two people. The trail literally behind the house around the lake is amazing and so is the nature area on the other side of the lake. Went for a nice walk and took me half an hour to get to the other side.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A good place to stay in Stockholm. The host is super nice and friendly.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had Linnea's place to myself as she was staying somewhere else during my visit. The apartment is a good size and within about a 7 minute walk to the metro station. It takes about an hour to get into the main city of Stockholm (but there were train upgrades happening which made it a little slower). Linnea purchased some breakfast food for me to prepare in the mornings which was a nice perk. I would stay here again if visiting Stockholm another time. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very friendly and generous family. Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. \r\nThe surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Vidhi and Bala are amazing hosts.\r\nI felt at home from the first moment.\r\n\r\nThey are very helpful and generous. The internet access + washing machine access helped me a lot during my trip to Scandinavia as well.\r\n\r\nLovely family and a very nice place. The location is great too, because it's like one minute walking from the metro station, and from there it's really quick to get to the main attractions in Stockholm. \r\nFood was really good too.\r\n\r\nIt was my first Airbnb experience, and it was not less than an excellent one. I am really glad I stayed at Comfort Stay @ Stockholm - Kista IT.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I stayed here for a few days before finding a longterm room for an internship in Stockholm.  Vidhatri and family were very welcoming and accommodating, and their hospitality was very helpful for my first few days in the city.  The breakfast and Indian food were also excellent (some of the best Indian food I've ever had).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vidhatri, her husband and teenage daughter are a really lovely family. They made me feel totally at home. She is a super quick communicator, very helpful, kind and considerate. \r\n\r\nThe daughter is the resident chef, her cooking as good as her mother's, I just loved the Indian vegetarian food, I had breakfast and dinner every day. \r\n\r\nMy room was very nice with a large double bed, plenty  of wardrobe space and a good desk for working. \r\n\r\nA very good experience in all respects and I have no hesitation recommending the room to other travelers. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vidhatri and her family is very god, generous and kind host. They are an exceptionally nice mannered, openhanded and helpful family. Vidhatri sent us  very exact and detailed instruction to get to their home. They show us a great respect by preparing a homemade breakfasts and coffee every morning. We could choose and we used a chance to try Indian food. We loved it! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was very good one. Her apartment is few minutes from metro, so very well connected to the city center. \r\nSeptember 2012</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at Vidhatri's apartment was great ! The family is very friendly and helpful for all kind of matters. The bedroom is spacious and equipped with a good bed, lots of wardrobe space and a desk (w/ Wifi). We chose indian breakfast, and did not regret it : we had different kinds of indian pancakes every morning, which were all very good ! We also ate at home one night : Vidhatri and her daughter Jessica teamed up to make this dinner a very enjoyable moment - both with food and conversation. We recommend staying at Vidhatri's home if you want to spend a few days in Stockholm, and we will do again if we come back. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a very pleasant and home-like stay with Vidhatri and family. From the first day itself, they treated me like house member. The room was tidy and good sized, with internet access, and even DVDs were offered with some interesting short films. :)  They also served fantastic dinner and we had quiet interesting conversations over the table with their family. Home cooked breakfast was a perfect start for day as well in Stockholm. Overall a very pleasant stay and highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vidhatri's place is very close to the public transit underground.  I found it to be very accessible and an easy way to explore Stockholm.  My hosts were very generous and offered to feed me more than my fill.  The room itself was a good size with a comfortable bed.  I enjoyed my stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vidhatri's place is awesome to stay, everything is comfortable. You have markets & train station near by you. I enjoyed staying with her & her family. They are good company always. Delicious food in lunch and dinner was ready before i woke up. Everything was just perfect for me. \r\nI would love to stay next time when i'm going to visit Stockholm. The best place ever. Feel as your home. Thank you so much again for everything.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Vidhatri and her family are excellent host. During our stay of 2 nights, they treated us family member. We had long chats with them and enjoyed their fresh home cooked, Indian vegetarian food. Their apartment is at throw of stone from last stop of T station (Akalla). They helped us with information on city, best use of T service and airport transportation.\r\n\r\nWe recommend their apartment by airbnb members and we will surly use their facility, whenever we are in Stockholm. we wish them all the best.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>(Website hidden by Airbnb) excellent host in stockhlom. Felt very much at home in her place. Hospitality, food and company she offered was so wonderful. The care she takes in satiating our Indian palate is to be appreciated. Hats off to B and B and hugs to Vidha. Umashree. India</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I stayed only a day and thanks to Vidhatri's advices and tips. I could enjoy the city (Stockholm) in the best conditions. \r\nI recommend her, she is an excellent guide and a great host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vida and and her daughter were really nice and friendly hosts! They picked us (me&my girlfriend) up at the train station and cared about us. Breakfast was good and Vida alway offered us drinks and snacks! Vida answered all our questions to Stockholm. We recommend her homestay to anybody!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Eventhough we where in Stockholm only for one night, I have good memories about my stay at Vidhatri's place. She cooked us a nice dinner and breakfast. The room itself was small but clean and quiet. I would recommend a stay at Vidhatri's appartement. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had a wonderful stay at Vidhatri and Bala's place. It was in a quiet location just a minute's walk from the metro station (2 minutes if you're slow). A 20 minute ride to center city, which was always the perfect length of time for me to plan out my day. And if you like Indian food, which I do, you're in for a treat - amazing food and great conversation as well! You'll never be hungry. I often had to skip lunch since I ate so much for breakfast, which was perfect since it allowed me more time to check out places in Stockholm. Most importantly of all, Vidhatri and Bala are just good people who really go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I would definitely recommend staying at their place, when it's available. Last but not least, if you enjoying running, there's hundreds of acres (if not thousands) of soft surface paths in a countryside setting right behind their place. I ran 12-18 kilometers a day when I was there and there always seemed to be new trails I haven't tested before. Always got the day started on the right footing!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We stayed two nights at vidha's place. A cozy place to stay! She is an amazing cook and such a kind person. Vidha and her husband were very helpful and gave us a lot of advices. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A good choice for a stopover before heading to the airport. Easy transport connections. Nice open air walkways which are welcome before heading into long flights. Shops and restaurants conveniently a few steps away. Close to metro which has lifts if you have luggage. Neat, clean and tidy. Nice extra touch was the offer of use of a secure wifi connection. \r\nThe area is a busy residential one so there may be some people noise - it didn't bother me but I am pretty travel robust.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a nice stay here, it was like homely living. Both the couple Vidhi and Bala received me as if own family member. Though my stay here was shortened by a day, I had very good time staying with lovely family. The food was really tasty. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My friend and I stayed for three days at Vidhatri’s house and had a fantastic time. Vidhatri and her husband, Bala, are lovely warm people :) They helped us from the start before we came to Sweden, advising us on which tickets to buy at the airport and directions.\r\n \r\nOn arrival we were given homemade pancakes and waffles, and each morning we were given delicious homemade food at whatever time we woke up. We especially loved our Indian breakfast! Their daughter helped us decide which places to visit, and we were made to feel so welcome it felt like home.\r\n\r\nThe room is large and spacious – definitely big enough for two people – and the bed is so comfortable! Metro is a 2 minute walk away, and the all night metros at the weekend made this a convenient place close to the centre, but also quiet enough to get a good night’s sleep. The room is exactly as the description says. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for having us! We loved Sweden and hope to see you again soon. Would definitely stay here again and recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Vidhi and her husband were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good recommendations on places to visit in Stockholm and we very much appreciated the home cooked meals. Their home is a little outside the main city (about 30 min by train) but the train station is 2 min away and trains are fairly frequent. We would recommend their place for future travelers. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Séjour à Stockholm réussi grâce à Vidhatri...grande chambre, accueil chaleureux tout en laissant de l'espace, intérieur très propre et à 20 mn environ du centre en ligne directe. Beaucoup de bons conseils et d'aide (réservations, vérification  des horaires de la ligne de bus de nuit pour prendre mon avion) et de succulents repas indiens! je recommande vraiment, des \"\"good vibes\"\" :)\"</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The room is cozy with a nice view of the park. The apartment has two bedrooms, a livingroom, a kitchen, and one shared bathroom. You really could not ask for a better location, easy access to the metro and grocery store coupled with the best nature you could imagine just a short walk away with cows, horses, pigs, goats, hills, and beautiful pastures. But thats not even the main reason I would advise staying at this location. Vidhatri and her family are very amazing people. They were very kind to us throughout our entire stay and extremely helpful when it came to providing directios and advice. They also make very delicious indian food which was always a plus. If you do not like eating vegetarian or do not enjoy exploring other cultures then this may not be the place for you. We however are very fond of learning and experiencimg different cultures so this was great for us. Additionally, everyone in this family seemed to wake up early in the morning, which would make sense since the sun rises at 4 am in Sweden. So it helps if you also prefer to rise early in the morning. Overall we really enjoyed staying in Sweden and being emersed in nature which this location provides.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks a lot for this super good stay!\r\nEverything went well, the apartment was super clean and the room had anything you need, incl. fast WIFI connection.\r\n\r\nBala is a pretty nice host and takes really care about the guests needs. Every morning, Bala prepared a fresh and delicious breakfast - thanks again!\r\n\r\nI really recommend this comfort stay, next to Akalla Metro station (15 minutes from T-Centralen Stockholm) - pretty easy to go there!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Vidhatri and her family are incredibly friendly and treat you like family; the hospitality was amazing and the energy is full of mirth. You definitely will start your days in the mornings with a full stomach!  I have learned lots of Swedish culture and how to make South Indian food, and without staying at Vidhatri I believe I might not have had such an amazing experience in Stockholm. \r\n\r\nThe location is VERY convenient! Only a three minute walk to the train station, and you can take it directly into the center of the city! The windows are huge and inviting in the kitchen area so you can have a morning stretch while looking at the stretches of nature before you.\r\n\r\nOverall: very pleasant! I believe it is the ideal place to stay during your visit to Stockholm.\r\n\r\nThank you, Vidhatri!

Most sites we wanted to see were within walking distance or an easy ride on the subway, about 1 minute away. The water pressure was strong and there was never a shortage of hot water. On are arrival Daniel gave us very good information about the neighborhood, stores, restaurants etc. We were delighted to find a bottle of sparkling wine in the fridge to celebrate the first night of our delightful honeymoon in Stockholm.

Very nice and personally. We met Daniel twice, when we arrived and later on when he very quickly came with a new coffemashine. Good machine and good coffee too. We appriciated the little balcony and the uppermadras for the sofabed. The road was more quiet than expected, only a few cars are passing. If it hasn't been for the good weather and the balcony the appartment is a little to small for 3 grown ups. Our grown up son (20) was very fond of the decor. Every thing works in the appartment. Daniel is a very reliable and pleasant host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My family and I had a great stay at Daniel's apartment. It was very cosy and well equipped.

Well, kidding about the last one, but, really, the lore was comprehending, we will now check out the bookstores for his Stockholm Guide, so much worthy his guidelines about life in Södermalm's region are. I skip the delicate part of how flexible he is as a host about various aspects any traveler might want to flex. And being most generous towards our egotistic manners was just one more precious quality of him, amidst whole a lot. Besides, we learned a couple tricks, which let us enter civilized society from now on,  so no more leaving the key under the floor mat, after all. Stockholm in Daniel's edition is great, what more can I say?</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lovely flat in Stockholm. Very good location.

Such a nice, funny and good guy.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is brilliantly layed out and decorated. So cleverly done and bigger than I thought from the photo. Other then that it looks exactly as the photos. Clean and cosy made us feel at home right away. Real character. BIG nice TV and a threat to have Netflix :) Nice soft bed.\r\n\r\nThe location is PERFECT. I twisted my ankle the week before we went, so it was so good to be able to quickly get back home for a little rest before going out again for more experiences. Lots of nice shops in the neighbourhood, very short to the subway/bus etc. and very good to have the opportunity to go outside on the balcony. \r\n\r\nWe are all ready planning our next trip :) Maybe just before Christmas, I can imagine Gamla Stan must be such a wonderland then.

The apartment is in a great location with lots of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops just seconds away and a quick walk from old town (Gamla Stan). Daniel was a great host who was very easy to communicate with and has lots of good recommendations. Check-in/out was very easy as well.

Would definitely stay at Daniel's place again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location, pictures were accurate, Daniel was very nice host.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My friend and I stayed at Daniel’s for a few days and we were very happy with the location. Daniel is an excellent host. His place is just as described and fit our needs. It may be a bit cramped for more than 2, but it worked well for us, as we spent most of our time exploring the city. We also enjoyed making some meals at home in his kitchen. Daniel was very responsive and helpful to us in planning our trip. We recommend Daniel’s place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very easy communication. We had a good stay, the flat is very closed to Gamla Stan and restaurants and bars.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very comfortable apartment in an excellent location. Like most flats in Stockholm it is small but was perfectly fine for 2 people + a baby. Check in was very easy using a keysafe and having Netflix on a massive TV was a plus. Thanks for a great stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Daniel’s place is in a fantastic location: about as good as you can get. Very convenient. The apartment itself is a small studio and quite cluttered, so probably best as a base for one or two people.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good. I would repeat if coming back to Stockholm</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is the best apartment if you want to stay in Stockholm because its location is more than perfect! Daniel answers you as fast as he can. Near the apartment there are supermarkets, subway and good restaurants and bakeries. The apartment was really clean and confortable.

Daniel helped for everything. The appartment is small but smart and in the good place close to city center and train station.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Daniel was a very communicative Host, who was super easy reachable via message and always responded quick. \nHis place is as shown in the pictures and you have 2 big sleeping opportunities. \nThe location is what makes his place so good tho! \nEverything is in walking range :) Unfortunately there was some construction going on in front of the house but Daniel is not to blame for that haha\nCheers again for the host!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>A really cute and cosy apartment in an amazing location, we were never far from the bars and coffee houses of the city!

Everything was perfect !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good location. Very central in Södermalm, which also means a little more noise. However, nothing that was enjoying to us but good to know if you are sensitive. Quick responses and replies from Daniel and easy checkin. A plus with balcony in warm/sunny days.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anita had a full house but organised our stay with her friend Bertil.  His new, modern  free standing house in a garden setting in a peaceful neighbourhood with  woodland area not far from a lake was a lovely place to stay. Amenities were very good, breakfast provided at an extra charge - good coffee. Bertil was helpful with information about exploring Stockholm and the surrounding area and discussing life in Sweden.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Anitta was most gracious and kind.  She made my mother and me feel at home and provided very good information about restaurants and sights in the city.  She even sent us on our way with some of her homemade apple cake! Her home is lovely, in à quiet neighborhood but a quick express train to the center.   Staying with Anitta made the big city of Stockholm feel manageable.  Thank you,  Anitta!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very cozy space, super friendly host! 5 mins away from the train station via 144 bus, and if good weather, 15 mins by walking. Strongly recommended for people who want to explore stockholm or to participate the furniture fair. Thx Anitta!\r\n </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I loved staying at Anitta's home! It is clean, cosy and comfortable with everything you need. Anitta is very welcoming and helpful and happy to answer any questions you may have, you will be well looked after. I have moved to Sweden temporarily and Anitta was an amazing help with many other things such as more permanent accommodation after my stay, which made my transition incredibly smooth. It is such a short walk around the corner to the 144 bus stop, and only a 10 minute bus ride to Fruangen T-bana. Långbro is gorgeous, with a lake and a forest nearby, and it's a great idea to stay here if you want to experience a quieter and typically Swedish area, it's very pretty. You will feel like a local and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone, thank you very much Anitta! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Anitta's neighbour  Hannela's place. It was a very cozy and clean studio apartment  with all the amenities promised. I stayed here for about ten days. The host was very friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with. Had good breakfast in the mornings. The place is near to public transport. I would prefer to stay here the next time I visit Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a good space. The room was large and clean. The environment is lovely and quiet. Great garden. The bathroom is shared but had no issues with waiting. Breakfast was acceptable and Anitta was helpful with questions. The nearest train station is  10-15 min walk away. There is a bus...but not frequent enough. Overall, good place. Thank u Anitta :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This flat/penthouse is absolutely amazing! I was so lucky to have found it and I enjoyed every minute of it during my 8 day stay there. Simply stated: you must stay here if you are in Stockholm. It is located in Norrmalm, one of the most sought-after areas of Stockholm, and is conveniently located to every attraction. Gamla Stan is only a quick and beautiful 25 minute walk away, the Stureplan district is maybe a 20 minute walk away. In the immediate neighborhood there is a small grocery store right across the street, an amazing Thai food stand/gourmet truck one block away, and for any Americans who may have withdrawls from lack of ranch dressing and an overabundance of ice (aka Me!) there is a Hard Rock Cafe 2-3 blocks away. Not to mention the numerous bakeries and coffeehouses within one block. I absolutely adored this flat: amazing views of a beautiful part of Stockholm, all the unique and beautiful art in the flat (the large painting in the dining room was the topic one night at dinner), the lovely foyer entrance, the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was absolutely perfect. And the flat is in a building that is over 100 years old, so you have the old architecture and the really nifty old elevator. And Seta is a perfect host-she is very friendly, nice, easy to communicate with, and when I had any questions she answered via text or offered to call right away. And this was Midsommar weekend, so you know she had other plans going on, but she was still very fast in replying. When I come back to Sweden again in the future, I will absolutely be staying here! I think anyone who has a chance to stay in this flat and passes it up is crazy-you simply must stay here. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Seta has a stunning apartment in a great part of Stockholm. It's full of character and unique art, and is great for entertaining. It has two good-sized bedrooms. Her place is highly recommended and I would love to come back.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We've stayed at the apartment for a week. We loved it very much. It's a big full of light apartment furnished with great taste. It's good located in the center and the same time  quiet. Owners were very nice and helpful.   </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed at Seta's apartment in a big family company with four kids (10, 6, 6 and 3 years old). We enjoyed our stay at the property for the following reasons: the place is spacious, conveniently arranged, decorated in style, there is enough light in the rooms, the staircase and elevator are very pleasant, the location was convenient for us (grocery store in 1 min walk, metro station in 5-6 minutes, several parks with good playgrounds in about 10-15 min), it is also possible to walk to the city center, Seta was responsive, accommodative and understanding host. Thank you!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The house is perfectly located and is absolutely gorgeous and very spacious. The 2 main bedrooms are beautiful and extremely comfortable. The 2 extended bedrooms are good but not as good ad the main 2 ones. The hosts are very friendly.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good location if you want to avoid public transport while visiting the city centre, museums, restaurants and do shopping. The apartment was more than photos can ever display ;) it was spacious, had The ambience! The whole place is fully equipped, from the kids department till kitchen. Seta as host was very helpful and her warm welcome gave a good start to our stay. We were three adults and two kids (10m/5y) and all that comes along. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>From the first interaction, Seta was an excellent and welcoming hostess.  The apartment is in an amazing location in Stockholm, walking distance to great restaurants, cafes, stores and all forms of public transportation.  Seta met us upon our arrival and made sure that we had everything we needed.  She checked in with us during our stay to confirm that all was going well.  The apartment was bright, spacious, and beautiful.  It was the perfect home base for our week in Stockholm. We especially appreciated the large kitchen and bathrooms.  The apartment was the perfect size for our party of five. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td> We spent two weeks in Stockholm in Setas Apartment, working for the Eurovision Song Contest. After a hard working day Setas Apartment is the best place to relax, a lot of space for everyones privacy. Ecspecially I liked that many little Buddhas everywhere. Everything was clean and the flowers in the living area made us feel good. The beds are comfortable, in the kitchen you can find everything you need. It was perfect for us, we will come back, maybe if Sweden wins Eurovision again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We (4 adults) had a wonderful experience.  There was ample room and more for us. It was great to have one large bathroom and a separate shower and 3 toilets! We made use of the kitchen for breakfast and some evening meals.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and there were several supermarkets and coffee shops nearby. We used the bus and underground (T-Bana) to get around plus it was easy walking distance to the city centre. Coming back to the apartment at the end of a busy day was a joy. The size of the place was amazing- we could all find a spot to un-wind and relax. All in all, Seta's apartment was a great find on AirBNB. Seta and her place exceeded all expectations. Thank you Seta. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What an amazing home!  \nSeta's home is very large, bright, quiet, central.  It is perched on the 3rd floor (Accessible via elevator) and the house is sun lit and very bright with open layout.  There are artworks throughout the home which brings out the character to the home.  Getting around is super easy as the bus station is immediately in front of the house and there are both Green & Red line T-bana(subway) stations near by.   There are lot of great dining options and stores near by as well.\n\nI had an opportunity to meet both Seta and her son in person, and they seem super kind and welcoming in many ways.  All-in-all, my family and I had a wonderful stay at Seta's place.  \n\nSeta, thank you for opening your home to us.  We love Stockholm and staying at your home has been a memorable Stockholm experience.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Fantastically beautiful apartment in a an amazing location.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The place is amazing! Beautiful, spacious, clean and very well decorated. The location is also very good with several bars and cafes nearby but also the metro and commuter train.\n\nIt is one of the best apartments one can stay at in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Seta's place is an amazing space which is well appointed, well located and filled with art. I would definitely choose to stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Seta’s Apartment is as good or better than the pictures display. Kitchen has everything you need, rooms are large, beds are comfortable and the place quite large. Every thing was clean and Seta is a great host</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Excellent location and great communication from Seta. We were 3 people who stayed there and found the apartment comfortable and within walking distance of lots of good restaurants and shops.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>David was very helpful and communication was excellent. The apartement is spacious and very conveniently located. Absolutely a recommended place to stay in Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We spent an amazing time in David place last week end in Stockolm. We were 4 friends and it was perfect for us.\r\nI particulary loved the design, it's very well decorated and so warm.\r\nThe apparment is near Odenplan subway station, so it's was so easy to go to the center of the city (in few minutes!) wich is very helpfull when you stay  few days!\r\nThanks David for your hospitality!\r\nLina\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location in a family area, not far from metro, supermarket around the corner, 15min from town center with a good walk and tasty apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>David's apartment was everything I was excepting. I felt he provided a great services throughout. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is very cosy and gave me a very good vibe from the second we arrived. It was really clean, too. It's location is also brilliant with a handful of nice little restaurant and bars close by and only 10 minutes away from the nearest tube. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to other travellers. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We (a family with three kids at the age of 3 to 9) stayed in David's appartment for four nights and we really liked that place a lot. The contact to David was very nice, he gave us good advices for our stay. In the appartment we felt very comfortable. You can feel that two architects live here. Everything is very functional, but warm and welcoming. There was only twice a little noise from the neighbours but this never lasted more than half an hour. Maybe they had a problem to fix. We easily found our way from the airportbus to the appartment, which was the best way (without underground and changing) to travel with the kids. Also bus no 2 is very helpful. We very seldom used the underground. The supermarket is around the corner which is open also during the weekend until 22o'clock and many little restaurants and bars. We had a very pleasant time and we can only recommend David's place. Hope we can come back soon to see more of this beautiful city. 4 days are definitely not enough. Thanks David! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great apartment with a fantastic host. \r\n\r\nThe apartment met all of our expectations AND more. It was clean, fully equipped and excellently located. We also loved the vibe and design of the place - certainly felt like a home away from home. \r\n\r\nDavid, the host, was extremely flexible with our travel arrangements and was a pleasure to deal with. \r\n\r\nI recommend this place to anyone planning on travelling to Stockholm. \r\n\r\nTHANKS!  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A wonderful place in a good location. Communication with David was good throughout the process from booking to check-out. The apartment was perfect for our needs. We were able to live comfortably and had easy access to public transportation.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>David was a very nice host, he was very friendly and helped us a lot. We felt very comfortable in his appartement and had a very good time. The appartement is perfectly equipped and has anything you need.\r\nIf you want to walk to the centre it takes you about 25min to get there, or get a metro and be there in 4 stops:-)\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>David var ett bra värd och han har en vacker lägenhet! Det var jag och en vän som bodde här och vi älskade den. Vi hade vår egna sovrum, ett härligt kök och vardagsrum, och vi var nära restauranger, kaféer, och barer. Det är enkelt att gå till Odenplan eller bara 25 minuter till Centrum. Det var snällt av David för att låta oss använder sin kylskåpet och mat, men vi var ute i staden så mycket. Det var trevligt att komma tillbaka till ett bekväm, folklig ställe att sova eller att ta en små frukost och kaffe. David var lätt att nå med frågor och visade mig runt omkring lite också. Tack!!\r\n\r\nDavid was a wonderful host and has a beautiful apartment! My friend and I lived here for four nights and we loved it. We had our own beds, a wonderful kitchen and living room, and we werve very close to good restaurants, cafes, and bars. It was easy to walk to Odenplan or only about 25 minutes to downtown. It was nice of David to offer his fridge and food, but we were out so much around town anyway. It was great to come back to a comfortable, homey place to sleep and maybe have breakfast and coffee. David was easy to reach with questions and even with his busy schedule showed me around a bit, too! Thanks, David!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>we had a great stay in the appartement of David. The flat has a cosy and stylish athmosphere and we immediately felt comfortable. The kitchen is simple but you find everything you need. The beds are both very comfortable and David even provides towels. The flat is in a calm and nice neighbourhood where you find also a lot of Cafés, Restaurants, shops and there are good connections to public transprt. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>David was a great host, always looking to help and provide us with all that we needed.\r\n\r\nIt's really easy to access the center of the city from the flat either via bus, metro or even walking.\r\n\r\nOverall, we had a great experience in Stockholm and David helped it to happen.\r\n\r\nSo thanks to him and good luck to him and his future guests.\r\n\r\nAnis</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>David was a good host, everything went as planned. His place is sooo cute and we got all we needed. I highly recommend! The neighbourhood was nice and it was easy to get around city from there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I really liked Davids place! The beds were comfortable and best of all was the inspiring interior. It didnt take long to get to the center and we found good restaurants nearby (tutto bello was worth walking to!). We were two couples staying at David's place for 3 nights. Would stay again :).</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>David was a great host!\n\n He met us at the apartment, showed us around and made some excellent recommendations for where to go and enjoy Stockholm!  \n\nThe beds were comfortable, the shower was also good. \nIt was a short walk to a supermarket and a bit further to the nearest Tunnelbana but very convenient in a nice neighbourhood.\n\nWe would definitely return!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>David was a great host! He was very responsive to all of our concerns and was very reliable. \r\n\r\nThe place itself is very beautiful--there are two comfortable real beds and the small space in the home is very well utilized. There's great decor and it has so much character. It is very beautiful. The beds are comfortable and the washer has a dryer. The place is complete with all the basics that you need. The only tricky part is the stove, which wouldn't really stay on and we never figured out how to make it stay on. There's also amazing light that filters through the place, and a supermarket 2 minutes away. \r\n\r\nThe location is a bit quieter and a 20 minute+ walk to some sights in Stockholm, but the neighborhood is safe and pretty. If you are with a large group, I recommend splitting an uber/taxi from wherever you are. Our party didn't mind the farther location because it was a wonderful place. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a really nice time in David's apartment, the location is great, communication with David was excellent, the flat was really spacious and comfortable. Overall a very pleasant stay in Stockholm, thanks.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had such great time at David's apartment! During the whole booking process it was very smooth with quick response. \n\nThe apartment is beautiful and accurate as it shows on the listing. Both beds were both very comfortable and we had a good rest at the place. Very cozy and chilled, just feels like home honestly! For girls, do bring a hairdryer with u if u need it as they don't it in the accommodation.\n\nIn term of location - the tube can be a bit of walking distance however the bus stop nearby gets u to all the location that u would needed as tourist. Big supermarket just round the corner for quick breakfast. We love the place and would love to come bk anytime! Thanks David! :) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gisli met us at the apartment and made sure we had everything we needed for our 3-night stay....even the use of the washing machine and drying rack, and some goodies in the fridge.  We enjoyed the pedestrian mall just a few blocks away and were able to walk everywhere we needed to go.  Very spacious 2-bedroom flat with all the amenities.  Thanks for a great Stockholm experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My husband and I spent 2 weeks in this apartment, which is in a fantastic location -- it's within walking distance of many popular Stockholm attractions, but also just a couple blocks from the transit center of Odenplan if you need to catch a bus or subway train. The apartment is extremely spacious with a washing machine, dishwasher, high speed wifi, and large master bedroom (plus a smaller 2nd bedroom with a trundle bed). It's across the street from a grocery store and there's a lovely konditori on the corner where you can buy baked goods and eat lunch. Gisli is also a great host -- he emailed several times during our stay to make sure everything was going well. I would definitely recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed in the apartment with three people for a week. The apartment is fine, nothing exceptional but for its purpose quite good. It is rather central, in walking distance to everything in the centre, and there are two metro stations that you can reach in a few minutes walk. There are also quite a few nice restaurants in walking distance. The only drawback is the noise: Sleep with an open window was for us impossible. And since there is a supermarket just across the street (good if you need to buy things), trucks deliver goods every morning. Usually, we would be awakened during working days between 6am-7am. If that is no problem for you, the apartment is a good place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gisli and his wife were perfect hosts.  Communication prior to and during our stay was excellent, while not being intrusive.  They were so kind and helpful!  The apartment is beautiful - in a lovely neighborhood, well maintained and very clean.  It's very convenient to shopping and sights to see.  We had a fantastic stay, only wish it weren't so short!  I can guarantee we'll be referring business to them and if we return ourselves, we'll be checking in to see if they still let the place out.  Great experience!  Thank you, Gisli and Pia.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The first thing you will note about this apartment is how organized and responsive Gisli and Pia are.  You will get a guide of where to go in the area, and any info you need about Stockholm.  Checkout was very easy and they were very flexible with time and dates.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the free food I found in the apartment, which is not common on airbnb.  \r\n\r\nI agree with others that the bathroom is not 5-star like the rest of the apartment, but it is still good and better than others I've used.  A new bathroom will be installed soon and in any case, this should still not put you off from choosing the apartment.   \r\n\r\nThe apartment may seem expensive compared to other cities but I think it is a good deal given its size and location, and much cheaper than hotels in the area.  \r\n\r\nThe location is excellent close to several resaurants including a Japanese and Italian restaurant which the hosts will tell you about in their guide.  It is also a quiet area and only a few minutes away from an underground station.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice well-equipped unit, exactly as described. Really well-equipped kitchen -- stocked with lots of food and beverages. The beds are comfortable. The building along with the surrounding area is safe and quiet. Its well-serviced by public transit: buses at the corner; the t-bana is nearby. The apartment is close to central Stockholm; its a 10-15 minute walk to Central Station. There's a good grocery store at the corner along with Nybergs Konditori (highly recommended).\r\n\r\nGisli met us at the apartment when we arrived. He showed us where everything was and gave us helpful information on what is around the apartment. He also answered our emails promptly; for example, forwarding a pdf with the washing machine instructions in english.\r\n\r\nA wonderful host, a nice apartment in a good neighbourhood at a good rate: what's not to like! Oh, and Stockholm is pristine.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A wonderful flat in the city center. It has a good atmoshare and it`s very cosy and there is a bathtub (that`s great). Gisli and his wife are  very nice hosts. We find fresh fruits and cold beer in the kitchen. We spent a nice time in Stockholm and will come back...</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I recently visited Stockholm for work with two colleagues and we stayed at Gisli and Pia's apartment.  I absolutely agree with past reviewers: this apartment is amazing.  It's centrally located and within a short walk to both metro and bus stops, with a supermarket literally across the street.  Visits to Stockholm University (which is what brought us to Sweden) was extremely convenient - basically a 10-15 min direct bus. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is quite spacious and more than comfortable for the three of us.  It's hard to see from the pictures, but the apartment is very well lit with lots of natural sunlight during the day.  The apartment is also equipped with all the necessary appliances and supplies you'll need, including a dish washer, clothes washer, and fully stocked kitchen.  \r\n\r\nGisli and Pia even greeted us with Swedish chocolate and fruit when we arrived and they've prepared a very useful packet of information with details about transportation, things to see, and places to eat.  \r\n\r\nCommunication with Gisli and Pia couldn't have been better.  Even though we didn't have a cell phone when we arrived, Pia (Gisli's wife) was waiting for us at the apartment with keys, towels, food, and information.  \r\n\r\nInquiries by email and phone are very promptly returned and they took extra care to make sure we were all set-up with everything we needed for our trip. \r\n\r\nI cannot recommend this apartment and the hosts enough.  Fantastic place to stay.  Especially great for those traveling with children (lots of space + washer) or for anyone visiting Stockholm University.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed 4 nights at the apartment of Gisli and his family. Unfortunately we did not meet Gisli in person, but Alexander was present to meet us and made us feel welcome instantly. The apartment is great for four people. Light and fresh and enough space to relax and feel at home. Quiet neigbourhood (no noise at night!) and friendly people. Central located and it is very easy to reach all major points of interest by feet (there is also an airtours Stockholm City Bikes station just around the corner).  The contact with Gisli was perfect; he gave good information and tips and responded emails by return. \r\nStockholm is so beautiful in summer and a great city to visit. \r\nI would strongly recommend to visit both the City and the apartment of Gisli.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a wonderful relaxing week in this apartment.  Quiet area, good location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was our second stay in Gisli's apartment, so clearly we love it there. There is a supermarket across the street and it is close to the pedestrianised street, Drottninggatan. The apartment itself is great. Light and airy but good blinds to block the perpetual day light in the summer time when you want to sleep. Highly recommended. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This Norrmalm apartment was an ideal base for our family exploration of Stockholm.  It was clean, spacious, comfortable and very well located - we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.  Our hostess Pia was great with coordination of our arrival, meeting us personally when we arrived.  She provided good advise on things to do and see and includes a nice guide to neighborhood restaurants.  Great experience overall.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gisli and Pia are excellent hosts.  They responded quickly to my inquiry and provided all of the information needed for my stay in Stockholm.  \r\n\r\nThe property was quiet, clean, and spacious.  Wireless internet fast and the kitchen well equipped.  The apartment is conveniently located within the city allowing me to walk to all of my destinations.  Food and restaurants in the area are excellent.  I will try to stay here again when I return to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fantastic stay. Gisli and Pia gave us really detailed ideas in advance for just about everything: groceries, local bakeries and restaurants, even which taxi company to use. The flat is quiet and conveniently located with good blackout shades in the bedrooms for the long summer days in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I stayed at Gisli's with my dad's family. We felt so welcomed and had an excellent time. The apartment is very well located and extremely comfortable. Also, the communication is super fast and more than friendly. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The hardest part about staying in Gisli's apartment was leaving it. If you want to stay at a large apartment in a residential neighborhood in central Stockholm, this is a wonderful place to stay. If you opt not to take long walks throughout Stockholm, the apartment is located near several bus lines and two subway stops. If you are bringing children, two excellent playgrounds are merely blocks away.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or want advice, the hosts are very responsive and knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Excellent people - really extremely communicative and hospitable. When there were a few problems they responded immediately - thanks! The location is great, lots of good restaurants, a great supermarket on the corner. The flat is very clean and tidy and easily accomodated 3 women. The building is quiet, a plus for most people, and one needs to be quiet and very polite to the residents when lodging there.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This flat is excellently located for exploring Stockholm. It is on a pleasant residential street with a local and reasonably priced grocery store on one corner and a lovely park down the street. Easy and enjoyable walk to just about every major site in central Stockholm. Lots of good dining options nearby.

Not a typical swede in a positive way as she is a very open and talkative person! \r\nBus connection to the city is pretty good (24/7) regarding the distance. The villa itself is perfectly modern equipped and the garden house offers the possibility for withdrawal and privacy. Madeleine also has bikes to rent out - a nice bonus considering the nature around!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Madeleine is very friendly and warm, easy going and very helpful.

She has multiple bikes that you can borrow. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Eva is such an amazing and wonderful hostess.

The house is located in a good and safe neighborhood about 5-10 minutes walk from metro station (Hagsätra), which is great! There is also supermarkets in the metro station so it is easy to buy food to the house. Eva-Marie was also very nice in coming to pick me up from the metro station when I arrived with my two luggages and her husband took me to station when I left, I really appreciated :) All in all, a really awesome stay and highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice and cosy apartment as beautiful as shown on the pictures! :p\r\nClose to nice bars and restaurants as well as metro station. In other words very well located!\r\n\r\nEverything went well with the landlord. Casper is a nice and funny guy. He takes good care of his tenants! :)\r\nWe were there as a couple and we truly recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My wife and I stayed for several days in Csilla's apartment, and it was quite perfect: spacious, bright, clean, airy, with south-facing windows looking out into the neighborhood and down to the garden.  The location is also very good, with many restaurants and shops nearby; well-served by buses, and only a few blocks from the metro.  The walk to the city center is pleasant, through good neighborhoods, and with scenic views across the water.\r\n\r\nCaspar and Csilla were highly communicative in making arrangements, flexible regarding our particular requests, and generous with their suggestions for places to see.  The key pickup was foolproof.  We had a great stay, and would recommend this apartment without reservation!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>What can I say? I had an amazing time in Stockholm and staying in this great apartment was definitely 1 of the reason why; the apartment was close to Gamla Stan, nice little restaurants and stores in the area, I felt at home during my stay in this apartment and, even though I didn't meet Csilla in person, I knew that I could reach her out if I needed help/assistance and she indeed helped me out on 1 occasion when I arrived in Stockholm...apartment looked exactly as advertised and I know that, should I return back to this lovely city, I wouldn't hesitate a second to rent this apartment once again! :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I booked this apartment for a college and i only heard good things about it. I went there the first day to check it out and it was very clean and nice. Everything went very smooth with the keyes and Czilla ans Caspar was very helpful!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My husband and I visited Csilla's place for 5 nights.  The apartment was clean and spacious and the neighborhood was ideal.  There are excellent restaurants, bars, and shopping all within a few blocks, Urban Deli was a favorite.  The train from the airport is an easy way to get to the apt.  Communication was quick and easy too.  I would stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Csilla and Casper's apartment is lovely, clean and very spacious. It's in a nice area of Södermalm with amenities close by, the metro station is a close walk and  is only 3 stops (about 5 mins)  into the main shops, bars and restaurants in the Stureplan area, or you can also walk which is what I did a few times. Transport in Stockholm is very good and safe, I travelled home very easily from a night out at 3am.  As hosts they were very easy to communicate with and very friendly also making sure that I was settled and if I needed anything - even when I was too tired to work out how to get into the main entrance (essentially very easy but I was having a stupid moment), Casper offered to come and help me. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, gave me the true experience of living in Stockholm, which is what I wanted and I would definitely recommend and stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very clean, perfect location, good bed en douche, good communication with the owners and just a very nice place which makes you holiday perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a perfect place to stay in Stockholm. The apartment was spacious, clean, had good furniture. Not far from the subway and coffees, etc... We had a good time there ! :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Csilla's apartment is even more charming and spacious than it appears in the photos, and we chose it because it was the best-rated-and-reviewed (as we read the reviews) of a dozen other apartments.  Everything about the apartment was first rate, including location and view, and this is where we will return when we come back.  Once we got to know Södermalm (we were there 15 days), we realized how wonderfully located this apartment is - 1-1/2 short blocks to Urban Deli (market), 2-1/2 to either of two great cafés, interesting shops all around, a wide choice of good restaurants,a few blocks more to Götgatan, and maybe a half-hour's walk total to the Old City. Bus stops and the subway were also nearby, and riding a bus to Östmalm from here was as easy as can be. Csilla and Caspar were great hosts, both easily reached by email or text. They gave us plenty of privacy, so we could explore and feel a part of the neighborhood, and they were there when we needed a little help.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Csilla's apartment is very modern and spacious, with lots of natural light.  The location is ideal, close to the restaurants and nightlife of Sodermalm, and within walking distance (5-7 mins) to the T-bana (which runs very frequently, making it easy to get around - public transport in Stockholm is excellent).  It is only a short walk from Katarinavagen, which offers great views across the water of Gamla Stan (old town), and about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan itself.  Communication was easy, and I received prompt responses to my  reservation request and any follow-up questions I had.  I would definitely recommend staying here while visiting Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very Nice and roomy apartment, full of light! Very good location in the middle of Sofo, the trendiest quarter in Stokholm (Södermaln)\r\nCasper an Csilla were wonderful hots, we receive very rapid responses to our emails, very easy communication.\r\nWe really recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Hemos pasado una semana fabulosa en Estocolmo, en gran medida porque el apartamento era estupendo. Sobre todo, porque se adapta perfectamente a las expectativas: la descripción y las fotos son muy reales.\r\nEspacioso, luminoso, limpio, decorado con sencillez y buen gusto, en un edificio y un barrio muy interesantes, Sodermalm es genial.\r\nLa comunicación ha sido fluida, la llegada-salida fácil y flexible, los anfitriones cercanos y simpáticos. Muy recomendable, gracias chicos!\r\n\r\nWe had a wonderful stay in Stockholm, especially for the nice apartment. It was exactly as you can see on Airbnb. Very bright, spacious, clean, well decorated but simple and really well located in a nice building, in one of the most interesting neighbourhoods in the city. Sodermalm is amazing!\r\nCommunication, arrival and leaving were easy and hosts are close and pleasant.\r\nWe can recommend it, of course. Gracias chicos!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Csilla & Caspar are really nice. I arrived in Stockholm late about midnight, but this was no problem and the welcome was warm; even in the night;-))\nThe appartement is clean, spacy and staying there was really a pleasure. The appartement is perfectly situated in Stockholm, in a good region with plenty of restaurants, but also the station of public transport ist just a real short walk away, one bus-station I had to use several times is even just in front of the building. It was perfect for a congress the first days, and also later for visiting Stockholm with my wife. \nWhen I'll come back to Stockholm, I would certainly check if this appartement is available. \nThanks a lot. \nMarc</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fantastic location, about 3 blocks to the T-bana (metro) and lots of options in the area for dinner and self-catering. Only wish more of the boutiques nearby were open but it was New Years after all.\r\nThe photos aren't exactly the same as the apartment right now but that's due to redecorating and rearranging of furniture.\r\nGreat kitchen with everything you need and good water pressure in the shower!\r\nNice and spacious, ideal for couples or those on business. We loved Stockholm and hope to go back someday!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My friend and I had a delightful stay at Csilla's place. It's beautiful, stylish, lots of natural light and space. It's nice and warm inside! It's in a good spot to go exploring. There's an amazing restaurant/bar very close by called Nytorget 6. Csilla was very helpful too!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our second stay in this apartment - again an excellent experience in terms of being welcomed and made to feel at home. The apartment is excellent and very well equipped, and the area is perfect for sampling summer life around the south part of Södermalm. Close to the metro/T-bana, and lots of bars and restaurants. Comes highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The house is amazing. Location perfect.  Check in /check out so easy.

There was no booking before us, so we were allowed to stay at the appartment as soon as we arrived at 10 AM. Please note that there is no wifi and that the price for 2 persons is more than indicated on the add (price for 1 person). </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was spacious, light and airy with large windows overlooking a courtyard garden.  It was well furnished and equipped with lovely wood floors in the lounge and bedroom.  The apartment is very well situated in a vibrant area with numerous nice shops, bars, coffee shops and restaurants within a couple of minutes walk.  The nearest Tunnelbana (subway) stop is about 10 mins walk away and if you don't want to use public transport you can walk to the old town in about 30 minutes.  \r\n\r\nAlthough we didn't actually meet Csilla the communication with her was very good and the arrival and departure was very easy and Csilla kindly let us leave our cases in the apartment for a couple of hours longer when we left as our flight wasn't until later in the day.  \r\n\r\nIf you want a nice comfortable, well equipped apartment in an excellent area then I would thoroughly recommend Csilla's apartment.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Csilla and Caspar were excellent hosts. They were very flexible and generous with check in and check out, accommodating my early morning arrival and departure times. The apartment was just as advertised in the pictures.  The living room area was quite large and spacious, the bedroom was comfortable with plenty of space, and the bathroom had a shower with good hot water and pressure. The location couldn't be better - right in a very central location in Sodermalm close to shops, cafes, restaurants, nightlife and a short walk to Medborgarplatsen metro station.  Everything was so convenient, I highly recommend. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was my first time in Stockholm and only for a couple of days. Jo's appartment is quite central and quiet, fully equiped. The place is a good starting point to travel accross the City. Jo was very friendly and took the time to advice me about what to see/do at night or during the day. The most difficult was to make a choice at the end!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is my second time at this place. The standards are good and neighbourhood is one of the city's most vibrant part. Close a shoping mall and a communcation hub. You can easily travel to the heart to the city and even to the university campus. Jo and her mother were friendly and I did everything to make things easy for me during my staying. I recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Its been preety nice to stay here! All was good and the location is rather convenient if you plan to use subway. \r\nConvinient to get from and to airport as well as to any other place. Nice appartment. Thanks</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was my first trip with Aribnb, and it was wonderful. But you all know that already. So, few words about Jo's apartment: first of all, Jo helped me with all the travel details, itinerary, etc., that made it easy to find my way around. The apartment is in a good location well connected to major transport arteries. Downtown just 10 min by metro. The flat itself is very cozy, warm, with lots of light, and you have your privacy. Jo is a great host who loves traveling herself! A recommended shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jo's apartment is a perfect place to stay in Stockholm and she was an excellent host.  It is a lovely apartment, clean, comfortable and I was made to feel very welcome by both Jo and her mother, Lidia who gave me the keys and showed me around.\r\n\r\nThey were both extremely helpful when I had some issues and I could not think of anywhere better to stay.\r\n\r\nGreat value and just moments from the metro station and shopping mall.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a pleasure staying at Jo's place. Lidia's tips were of great help on where to go and how to get around. The new, sunny and clean apartment is well located and very well deserved by public transport; metro, bus and tram are all indeed within 1 mn reach from  the house and one can even walk to Gamla Stan (about 45 mn). Lilhjiholmen is a safe neighborhood and one could enjoy the lake/park/river behind the metro station (nice area deserving a tour). As if it was not already good enough, Jo is a very nice, warmhearted and friendly host. Should I go back to Stockholm one day, it will be at Jo's place without hesitation.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My stay with Jo was fantastic. I was there for 5 nights and she made me feel incredibly welcome, it was like a home away from home. Lovely place, great room and the location is excellent, nice and close to the train line, which is only a short ride into central Stockholm. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our impressions after stay in Jo flat are good and meet or exceed expectation. \r\nJo as well as her mother was kind and open for help. From 6 days we stay Jo spent only 2 nights and other time we was alone. Flat is located 150 meters from Underground station and 100 meters from the bus connection to Arlanda airport.  \r\nThe flat is quite big, light and good equipped. Guest room is not large but has all necessary thidgs.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice, clean, modern place. Jo's communication was great. Her mum was there to check me in and was kind and helpful. I met Jo later in my stay and she was kind as well. It was an easy 10 minute subway ride to/from central station and easy to get to other areas of Stockholm as well. Area is quiet and there is shopping available within the complex if you need food and such. All around a good comfortable stay.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Joana's apartment was spacious, nicely illuminated, clean and comfortable. All the facilities are provided and the location is excellent. It is close to many shops and great transport connections too. Lots of places to eat and the shopping centre on your doorstep. No wireless in the flat - but you can get this at the McDonalds nearby.\r\n\r\nJoana was accommodating and a flexible host. I was made to feel like I could come and go as I pleased and I think this was fine.\r\nThe room was good - had a good wardrobe, desk and comfortable bed. As much as I wanted. Kitchen was very  nice.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"- welcoming perfect\n-excellent location\n-very small room\n-no wifi internet\n- roles acceptable for non smokers and above average for smokers \"\"not allowed to smoke on balcony\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jo was courteous and very responsive to my questions, and the apartment itself can't be beat in terms of access to public transportation. I didn't realize how important this would be until I arrived in Stockholm, and wow, I feel like I lucked out. The apartment is around the corner from a Metro stop, plus there is a very affordable direct bus to Arlanda airport also right around the corner. This was a good place to come back to after long days of sight seeing.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jo's apartment was an excellent option for me. The apartment itself is well kept, light and in a quiet area. Metro and bus lines are just outside the building. This made it very convenient to travel from/to the airport and to the city center. Jo's mother provided me with lots of suggestions and city secrets, witch made it easier for me to get around.\nHad a good time at Jo's place and would recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a great stay in Stockholm. The room was small, but clean and exactly as described. I had everything I needed (desk, good Internet connection and a central location). The Tunnelbana stop Liljeholmen (underground metro) was literally across the street and there was also a Lidl store and a big shopping centre just around the corner. I didn't meet Jo as she was travelling herself. However, we were in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) and on the phone and she made sure that a friend of hers checked me in, which all worked out fine. I also met her mum, who dropped by to see if everything was ok. The flat was very quiet day and night, so perfect after a busy day of sightseeing or attending a conference in the city. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jo's apartment was perfect! Very easy to find and Jo met me in Leljeholmen square to walk to the flat (2 minutes). Communication was great and the room is fine and very comfortable.\r\nThe location is amazing and couldn't be closer to the metro line with the main city only a few stops away. Liljeholmen itself is very cool with a big mall that the apartment is attached to which is great for shopping. \r\nI'd highly recommend staying with Jo, she's really friendly and was able to help with questions I had about Stockholm and the local area.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jo's apartment was so cosy, comfortable, good located, very close to Liljeholmen underground station, tramway, bus stop, shops, comercial center.

Jo is a good hostess!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice flat located close to the direct subway to the center of Stockholm.\nA good choice to visit the city</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The location is very good for transportation, however, the room size is extremely small. Cleaningness may be a concern if you are staying more than 2 days.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jo was absolutely brilliant from the first contact to the last, she met me once I got off the bus and within 2 mins we were in her apt, which was beautiful, clean, bright and cosy, I couldn't ask for anything better. The location was brilliant, it was beside the bus stop, metro and tram and also there's a shopping centre beside you along with different places to eat and drink. I was running in the Stockholm marathon so getting to the expo and starting area only took me 16 mins by Meto. I can't say enough good things about Jo and her accommodation, she is a brilliant host. I totally recommend her place. I hope in the future to return there and enjoy all that Stockholm has to offer.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I came to Stockholm for a professional meeting and found Joanna’s flat a perfect place to stay as it was conveniently located for public transportation both to the meeting at the Stockholmsmassan and also the town center (about 20 min to each).  She’s a fine host and was friendly, flexible with check in, and gave great tips on exploring the town.  Apartment is clean and quiet and communication was excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very hospitable and knowledge host, outstanding location, private single bed room, excellent transportation options. Overall great place to spend a short 1 week trip in Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Jo’s for two nights. She was a great hostess. The bedroom was nice and I would definitely stay there again. Jo was quick in responding to my questions. The area was quiet at night which helps with a good sleep.

Check-in and out went smoothly.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>JO is amazing woman supportive and kind she will provide you with everything you won’t ask for a thing \nHer apartment very cosy, clean and beautiful located near the main station so all places are near from you \nTotally recommended for any visit to Stockholm for work or vacation.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good experience, you feel like part of home</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good experience.

Her house was very nice, very spacious and accommodating. We had a 1 year old with us who had no problems settling into the house. All the essentials was provided for. We had movie nights in when it was rainy with a good selection of movies. I would recommend Malin's home, lovely, clean, spacious and in a very convenient location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a very nice staying in Coretta apartment, close to the center and with all you could need to stay confortable.\r\n\r\nShe was very kind letting me know all the good things/places of the city and close to the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe only thing is that I went thinking she had internet/Wifi and that was not the case. I could connect to an open wifi over there, but very badly. I would reccomend double check this things with the hosts.\r\n\r\nI would come back again (with internet) by sure.\r\n\r\nThanks Coretta :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great time staying in Coretta's appartment.

Because it is located in old town we have to take some stairs up to find the location in the street and after enter the door on the first floor, there are still stairs before finding the  room. It will be a bit hard if taking heavy luggages. But it is great that Correta helps a lot for taking good care of us, including guidance for city visit and shopping. Very good company to stay with:)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I loved staying at Cor´s.\n\nFirst of all, she is super nice and very friendly, helpful and she was amazing with me coming super late at night because my plane was delayed. \nHer flat is cozy and the room I stayed in is big enough and has its own balcony!\n\nThe flat is situated right in the middle of the hipster part of Stockholm, walking distance to city center (15 minutes) and all the bars and nice restaurants.\n\nWe had a couple of nice chats with Cor and if there was more time, we would definitely talk much longer! \n\nHighly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had the most wonderful time in Stockholm.  We love your city.

All secrets about her apartment are explained in a little binder which was really helpful for us. Stayed with my girlfriend, her parents and our little son at her place. There is plenty of room (even two more people could have stayed in the bunk bed, which we did not use) and especially for kids there is an enormous amount of toys which our son enjoyed very much. Elisbeth provided a babybed and a highchair when we asked for it which was very nice. The kitchen is very well equipped - it was the first time I used an induction oven. Very nice and fast. The aparment is located very centrally. Most interesting parts of Stockholm are in walking distance. A breathtaking view of the city center ist just 100 meters away. A supermarket really close by. I can just recommend Elisbeth for Stockholms visits, especially for families. We had a great time in July in Stockholm. The weather was fantastic and the aparment was perfect for us. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had an excellent stay in Elisabeth's charming flat. Cosy, well equipped, lots of toys for the children etc. Elisabeth has made a very useful book with all the information you need about the flat and the neighborhood. The area has a good atmosphere, the supermarket is not far away, and you can reach the center of Stockholm in a few minutes by bus. I can only recommend Stockholm and this flat!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had the best time in Elisabeth and Henrik's flat! They have just let us the place as they are used to live in : very nice place in a wonderful area, well-organised flat, with all you need and more... Their children have the most amazing room that our kids have never dreamed about, and gently let other children play with everything. Elisabeth and Henrik welcome their host as if they were friends for years, but let them live in here without being intrusive at all. We have just loved being in here... and hope to come back soon!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice flat in very good placed surrounding area. Reliabel hosts. Nothing to complain!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a wonderful stay in Stockholm. It felt so good to return to a cozy apartment in the evening after a day of sightseeing. The kids were very happy. Tack så mycket!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Ric the owner is friendly and responds to various requests in a timely manner even he was not staying in Stockholm during my stay. Rics neighbour was very helpfull also oround various practical matters. Rics place is beautifully situated with good views to the area, very close to public transport in a more upmarket part of Stockholm, worked for me and highly recommendable. \nLars</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had the chance to be Rics roommate for just over two months and I have to say that my stay was very pleasant and we got along very well. Ric is just the perfect host, he is pleased to tell you everything about the extremely nice neighborhood and suggest you good restaurants nearby. During my stay I was living in the upper floor, with an own bathroom, a nice bedroom and a balcony from where you have a beautiful sight of the waterside. Furthermore I was able to make full use of the kitchen as well.\nThe apartment is located in the beautiful area of Hammarby Sjöstad, it's perfect for walks arround the waterside. And you have the tramstation right in front of the house and need approx. 20 minutes to get into the city center.\nI can fully recommend staying with Ric!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>You will have a big bed and a nice balcony with a nice view. It is very easy to Go to the City because the subway station is right before the door. \nRic is a host who has good ideas and tips and who is always willing to help and talk.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a very good experience staying at Ric’s place. The neighbourhood is nice, there is a lot of space and nature around and it’s not far from the city center. Ric is easy going and social. The room is big and confortable, as well as the bathroom. I would definitely recommend this place !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was great. As described and as pictured. First about the apartment: Light, big livingroom, great cooking area, well stocked kitchen, good food preparation space and comfortable table to eat at. Mira left the refrigerator largely empty so plenty of room for stocking food. Refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher. Internet worked well. Big screen TV worked with a limited set of stations. Bed in the bedroom is either a single or twin. Comfortable but not a bed for a couple. Was told the sofa in the living room can convert to a space that sleeps two.\r\n\r\nAbout location. I couldn't have been in a better place. In the immediate neighborhood (a few blocks) are a park, an ICA supermarket (on Dalagatan), many restaurants (which I didn't try). Close enough to downtown to walk to Central terminal/City Hall area (about 1.5 kilometers), Old City, Palace and Cathedral about 2 km, port area about 3 km (2 miles), Vasa Museum on Djurgarden about 4km (2.4 miles). I walked to all and the walk, through residential and retail areas is pleasant. Stockholm is a great walking city. For those who don't want to walk, the public transportation is also great. I took the Flygbussan from Arlanda to St. Eriksplan and had a 5 minute walk to the apartment. There are 2 T stops within a 10 minute walk, St. Eriksplan and Odenplan. I took the T and bus to Drottningsholm Palace from St. Eriksplan in about 30 minutes. The 53 and 69 buses are a block away. Both go downtown and the 69 goes along the harbor street Strandvagen. Also took the east-west bus along Odengaten to get to a meeting.\r\n\r\nFinally, the host. She left the apartment in great shape, a long note on the where things were and how to use the washing machine/dryer, dishwasher and trash. Made easy arrangements for me to pick up the key and leave it when I left at 5am for the airport. This was the first time I used Airbnb and my experience with both the apartment and the host was great. Would book it again if I was headed to Stockholm.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I spent more than 2 months in Mira's apart and It definitely was an excellent experience to stay here. It's bright, very well equipped and with good furniture. The area is perfect with many restaurants nearby, subway/train/buses around and 15 mins walking distance to the city center. And of course Mira is an excellent host, she was ready to help with everything I needed.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay was great. Jarl provided us with fresh bread and breakfast each day, offered us lovely International beers from his own fridge and even got us some typical Swedish buns for our journey home! The sauna was a nice way to relax after a busy day of sightseeing.\r\nThe apartment is in a good location for walking into the centre and there's a 7-Eleven at the end of the street for bits and pieces.\r\nThanks Jarl!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Extremrly nice and clean apartment with a very good description as to find the place. Good breakfast as well.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jarl's apartment is beautiful. It's in an amazing area, two stops from the central station. It was easy to find and very comfortable. Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Jarl, he was extremely helpful throughout the stay! Thank you for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>An excellent experience all-around. Jarl's room is probably the first AirBnB room I would readily return to, if I had the opportunity. Jarl is low-key and helpful. Fridge is stocked with the essential. Jarl also provides maps and brochures to help you navigate Stockholm. Highly recommended! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very pleasant stay at Jarl's. The room was very tidy and light. The bathroom is a bit small, but has a good shower and is really clean. Jarl provided breakfast and we could get anything from the fridge we wanted, this was very practical since we didn't have to decide at what time we would get out of bed. The house is really central, a 5 minute walk to T-bana station 'Stadion'. But you can easily walk to Gamla Stan as well, it took us about 20 minutes. \r\nTack sa mycket Jarl! \r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl is a fabulous host. He's fun, easy-going, attentive, and sharp-minded. The instruction he provided made it very easy for me to find my way in when he wasn't there. Smooth communications during my stay. The apartment is very clean, cozy, quiet, and well-located. I spent 5 nights there and was lucky enough to have some good chat with Jarl. The place really made me feel at home in a foreign city. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Just met Jarl briefly, but he is a great host and everything was as promised! Very central and nice location, cool room. Breakfast very good. I will come again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed at Jarl's apartment for 6 days. I am a musician and was there for a job audition. Jarl was very supportive and let me practice in the room. Everything else went also very nice and smooth, just like the good reviews by other people below. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl was a great and welcoming host. The room was exactly as described: big enough for two people, with a comfortable bed, and good light. In the fridge, there were plenty of things to have breakfast.  The flat is a 5-minute walk to the train station and 20-minute to the center of the city.  If I return to Stockholm in the near future, I would look for Jarl once again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl was friendly, courteous, and filled with good information about getting around Stockholm.  The location is not right in Central Stockholm, but it is quiet and well within city limits.  It is in walking distance to Djurgården where the Vasa Museum, Skansen, and other tourist sites are located.  Breakfast was wonderful, and I would stay there again very easily!    </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My second time staying here, as I was very pleased the first time.  The location is great and the place is well taken good care of (always clean). Jarl is a great host.  This will be my first choice when visiting Stockholm next time.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very efficient and flexible host. It was no problem for Jarl that we arrived while he was away from home and his apartment is conveniently located and very comfortable. Communication was excellent and it was nice meeting his kids. Very much like a home away from home, I would definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl very good host. Jarl always answering questions, helping to navigate to transport. He has a wonderful and funny kids! I advise you to stay at the Earl.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl left me the best bread I ever had in Sweden! Although I didn't meet him, he arranged everything perfectly and answered all my questions about getting around, laundry, etc, promptly. The room was clean and spacious and only a 5 minute Metro ride to the old town. There's a 7-11 at the corner for your late night ice cream craving and a good cheap Thai takeaway 5 minutes walk away. If you know how expensive things are in Sweden, you'll know this is a Godsend. Last but not least, the shower is hot and has strong water pressure. The apartment has a good feel about it. I highly recommend it. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great room for any activities in Stockholm! Jarl is a great host even though I was not able to meet him in person. Maybe next time. He's really flexible and don't hesitate to ask him anything you might need (an iPhone charger in my case).\r\n\r\nThe area is great as well! I checked out the Thai take away and the Chinese place and both were a good choice to get nice meals.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl was a great host, very helpful and accommodating. I had a good stay at his place and everything was just as advertised. The place is in a convenient location with easy access to subways. I would definitely stay at this place again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jarl is a courteous and gracious host. He is an excellent resource on Stockholm and Sweden generally. He went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay.  The room is also excellent, quite large with a nice desk.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good stay and experience with Jari.  The room was good, the bed was just barely wide enough for two but we managed.  Jari was very helpful and friendly.  It is a short walk to the subway for a short, two stop ride to the city center.  \r\nWe were able to walk from the Tallink ferry terminal, but the trip from the train station is longer and would need the subway.\r\nWe had a very good experience her and recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Stayed with Jarl for one night in Stockholm. Great location, very good instructions of how to get there, a lovely and clean room and such a friendly host. I would definitely come again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I cannot fault Jarl on his instructions; he answered emails almost instantly and the directions to his apartment were excellent.   The room was very comfortable and more than adequate for my needs.  Jarl was very friendly without being intrusive and made me feel very welcome in his home. I would definitely recommend his apartment to others planning to visit Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl was a really nice host, and everything worked good, especially the communication. It was my first airbnb stay, and I can really recommend visiting him. Also the bed was really comfortable :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was great to stay with Jarl. I went for a short business trip to Stockholm and it was the perfect place to stay. Jarl was very nice, always ready to help and always reachable. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, and you have good public transportation nearby. I did not have any problem finding the place nor moving around.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jarl is a kind, considerate and professional host who gives 100% to his clients and only asks in return that you respect his property and possessions.  \nI used the sauna, found the laundry room to be an excellent asset also and everyone I encountered was helpful and language issues for English speakers were minimal.  Jarl provided comprehensive transport, food and building access advice as well as a perfect internet access.\nI wish more AirBNB suppliers offered the same level of diligence.\nThe Stockholm Marathon was epic and I hope to visit Jarl again in the future but for longer.\nThanks Jarl you were a credit to Stockholm and the AirBNB community.\n\nTake care\n\nHoward\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl had been a friendly and very flexible host. \nWe had a good time in Stockholm and enjoyed our stay very much. \nThe area in which the apartment is located is close to the city. Thanks for the bike cards - this made a perfect city cruising day. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a pleasure staying in Jarl's flat. It is in a good neighbourhood, in a convenient location close to the centre and public transport. I always felt safe even when returning late in the evening. There is a small convenience store right on the corner for essentials like milk and juice. It is very clean and even though Jarl could not be there during my stay, he did his best to make me feel welcome in his absence. I was grateful that he had cereal and very nice coffee that I could have for breakfast.  He was very helpful and sympathetic to all my concerns, and he always answered emails promptly. The room is exactly as shown in the photos, light and well equipped. I would definitely recommend to others. Thank you Jarl!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl is a very good host, easy to talk and I enjoyed my trip in his apartment. Very good located and close to everything. I recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl is a very friendly host. He is really knowledgable and always available when I have questions. His room is nice and cozy. The place is located in a convenient position. It takes a 5-minute walk to the metro station and bus stations which are connected to most of the places in Stockholm. There are good restaurants around too. To sum up, it was a great experience staying in Jarl's place and I would highly recommend his place to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jarl's apartment was in a good central location (only two stops from Central station!). Supermarket and bakery 2 minutes walk away. Jarl was friendly and welcoming. Great guy and great price for where you stay! Would definitely recommend it </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jarl was an excellent host, the bed linen was clean and towels were provided. A nice quiet area about 20 min walk into the center of Stockholm.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really nice host, the room is big and confortable and the location was good for discovering the city </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Cecilia's flat seems to be one that is frequently available in Stockholm.  It was a relief being accepted by her after several others responded that they were going to be using their flats at the time we would be in Stockholm.   The rooms in this flat are spacious and light filled.  The bed was the most comfortable in our whole three week travels through Scandinavia.  The elevator was a big help in getting our luggage into and back out of the building.  The nice marble spiral staircase was not a problem when we weren't carrying heavy loads even with the apartment up 4 flights - and we are seniors.  Another convenience we appreciated was the laundry facility in the basement, though it took some guessing to figure out how to work the machines since we don't know Swedish.  Cecilia had a newly opened box of laundry detergent in the flat which was a big help once we found it.  We needed so little and didn't want to have to buy a whole box.  We also liked having recycling and trash disposal on the ground floor. The Coop grocery store nearby carried organic food selections which was important to us, and a good bakery was next door to it.  Having our breakfast and evening meal in the flat saved us lots of money.  Transportation around the city was very easy from here by subway.  All in all it was a very pleasant and convenient place to stay in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location. Nice appartment near the subway, near two supermarkets and a nice Italian restaurant and coffeebar/terras on the square below the appartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Hi\r\nWe loved our stay in Stockholm. The apartment is a great size and is in a wonderful position - 2 mins from the nearest underground station, 1 minute from a good supermarket. The area itself is lovely and is a perfect place from which to explore Stockholm\r\nCecilia is a lovely host .\r\nWould absolutely recommend this accomodation</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Cecilia's apartment is more than you wish for when looking for a holiday apartment! It's bright, spacious, and exquisitely decorated. The kitchen is well-equipped and (as others previously stated) the bed is very comfortable. The apartment has a perfect location - the metro station is right across the street, there are many bus stops in the area, the same for big supermarkets (Hemköp, Ica, Coop). There's also a wonderful bakery and a systembolaget really close. I highly recommend walking up the street to go to Monteliusvägen - a wonderful path which gives you an amazing view of the city. The Old Town can be reached in 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by metro. If you're into vintage and retro, the SoFo district is really close and a few vintage shops are actually really close to Cecliia's place.\r\nThe contact with the host was really great - Cecilia helped me a lot and was really quick at responding. Everything went really smooth and I really recommend staying there!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great spacious apartment! Nice and central in Söder (the ~malm is silent as I learned during my stay :D). Stones-throw from the metro that will get you where-ever else you need to be.\r\n\r\nThough we did not meet Cecilia was super helpful with good comms throughout my stay and superb directions to get me there in the first place.\r\n\r\nRecommend.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We very much enjoyed our stay at Cecilia's flat.  It is spacious and light.  The location is also excellent with good cafes nearby and a metro station only a minute away.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment was perfect and Cecilia is great. There was a slight mishap with keys when we got there, but Cecilia could not have been more responsive and so it was almost like nothing happened. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is as advertised - gorgeous, spacious, comfortable and super clean (she really gets it professionally cleaned before each guest visit). Super close to the metro so that was nice. I am sensitive to noise, so even though the apartment is close to some good nightlife, it is super quiet. I'd stay here again if I come back to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good time in Cecilia's flat. The area is very nice and perfect to walk next to the water into town. The communication with Cecilia was friendly and uncomplicated. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We liked the apartment and the neighborhood very much.  We were in Stockholm during an unusual heatwave, and had to leave the  windows open at all times.  This made the apartment a bit noisy  at night,  but it is quiet when the doors and windows were closed.   It is in a terrific  location  for  going anywhere in a Stockholm -  the subway stop Mariatorget  is a block away, buses on Hornsgatan, and a great neighborhood to walk around in.  Nicely furnished and very spacious.  The kitchen was very well equipped.  I really liked the art.  The fact that there were two balconies was terrific.  Communication with Cecilia was good..  We would gladly  stay there again.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Cecilia made arrangements for us to pick up the keys to her apartment at a nearby cafe. Once we had the keys and the code to the downstairs door, we were happily ensconced in Cecilia's truly beautiful Stockholm apartment.  It is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and eat-in kitchen, plus TWO balconies. Unlike many apartments that we have rented, this one was obviously not simply an investment rent-a-place, but her very own apartment. We felt like we were friends who had made arrangements to use her place while she was out of town.  This intimacy had some distinct advantages. The kitchen, for instance, was fully equipped and set up because Cecilia, who we would guess is an excellent cook, had cooked there recently herself. It was a pleasure to prepare meals there and eat at the little kitchen table. The art on the walls and the various objets de art throughout the apartment always provided visual entertainment and often food for thought. The apartment was very clean and, well, charming. The only drawback was that there was not a lot of space for us to stow our own stuff, but we quickly figured out that minor problem and enjoyed ourselves in this sophisticated and beautiful space.\r\n\r\nThe location was also very satisfying.  Located on one of the main drags in Soderholm, filled with cafes and small shops, the apartment was an interesting fifteen to twenty minute stroll to the Gamla Stan, Stockhplm's old town. There were grocery stores within a half a block, subway stations five to ten minutes walk, and the one of the City Bike stands was only a few blocks away. I should also mention that although the flat is on the fifth floor, there is a dependable lift.  \r\n\r\nIf you a re visiting Stockholm and get a chance to rent this apartment, don't hesitate.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a great time for 5 nights in this apartment. Communication with Cecilia was good. The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a really nice area of stockholm with supermarkets, cafes etc... all really close. Wifi was fast, the place felt (Website hidden by Airbnb) complaints at all. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We stayed for 4 nights at Cecilia apartment.\r\n It's such a lovely place, big, light and  in an excellent location, close to Gamla Stan. Metro, stores, cafes - all nearby within a walking distance.\r\nCommunication with Cecilia was excellent.\r\nI recommend it to everybody who wants to visit Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Cecilia's apartment is absolutely charming. We loved her artwork, furnishings, and collections. It doesn't feel cluttered at all just well-curated and thoughtfully chosen. By the end of our stay, I wanted to sit down and ask Cecilia about her travels and interests. I love light and air and the two balconies - one of the kitchen and one of the dining area - were perfect. Everything is clean and well-organized. Communication with Cecilia was quick and easy. The flat is in a great location with tube stop, grocery stores, an excellent cafe, and a vegetarian restaurant steps away. It was also easy access to Slussen and Gamla Stan. Would love to come back!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice apartment, prime location. Cecilia was very welcoming, and communication before and during the stay was excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Cécilia. \r\nNous n'avons pas eu la chance de la rencontrer mais elle s'est montrée très flexible au niveau de l'arrivée (23 heures) et a été tres réactive au téléphone.\r\nSon appartement  est tres bien situé, le quartier est agréable, le metro est à 5 mn à pied mais nous avons pu visité toute la ville sans prendre les transports.\r\nLa décoration de l'appartement est trés personnel, c'est intéressant et loin du standard triste des chambre d'hotel\r\nl'appartement est tres bien chauffé (important s'il fait -4 dehors) et j'ai rarement dormi dans un lit aussi moelleux !!\r\nun vrai cocoon!!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a wonderful five days in Cecilia's apartment. Such a fascinating space with beautiful light. The location is fantastic,  in the cool Sodermalm area, and within easy reach of the main sights of Stockholm, with excellent  public transport connections. Handover was very smooth. We would highly recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything was prepared for us - we didn't meet Cecilia but the keys were left with all the information we needed. The flat and the location were incredible - the flat is spacious with little balconies front and back to get the sun at any time of day - and it's within walking distance of Gamla Stan though the metro is so close and so good you don't need to worry about walking. We had a great time and would certainly go back there.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Cecilia's home is amazing!  Great location, great views, clean, and very well decorated!  We stayed for four nights and my husband and i joked that we would just love to live there.  I cannot say enough about this gem of an apartment.  Thank you to Cecilia!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We really enjoyed our stay at Cecilia's apartment. It looks just like in the pictures: spacious and full of art. The apartment lies in a nice neighborhood. Very close to the metro, a big supermarket on the corner of the street, and a very good cafe (Kaffeebar) next door. Although we didn't meet Cecilia in person, communication was good and we could pick up the keys in the restaurant next door. \r\nThe only impractical thing is that there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, so the bathroom was full of water after showering.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was really spacious and nice. Just as described. \n\nPerfectly situated in order to explore either Söder and the rest of the city.\n\nRestaurants, shops and subway are just a few steps away.\n\nThe flat is on the 5th floor, but has an elevator, so even with luggage, it's no problem.\n\nWe didn't meet Cecilia personally, but the conversation was really good and the check in and out perfectly organised.\n\nSo it's a really nice place to stay which we can definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Cecilia's apartment is great - the bed is super comfy (always important); the water pressure is great in the shower, the kitchen is equipped (though the knives are a little dull, but other than that, you'll find what you need for basic cooking). It's super close to the subway, great coffee shops, multiple grocery stores, bars and restaurants. It's really an excellent value for the money. I highly recommend staying here! (This was my second time.) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great apartment, easy to get to and from the central city. Very good communication and directions. Very comfortable stay in a good location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Excellent location - about 15 minute walk to Gamla Stan, less than a 5 minute walk to the subway station. The neighborhood of Sodermalm is great; many good coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The apartment is well-equipped, with a fully stocked kitchen, spacious bathroom, and comfortable bed. There are also two lovely balconies to enjoy when the weather is nice!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I definitely recommend Cecilia's apartment. Very good location (in terms of shopping, eating out and travelling around the city) as well as stylish and functional interior.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a wonderfully comfortable stay in Cecilia's apartment. It's stylish, full of personal touches, and in an excellent location - a quiet apartment with the city centre reachable by foot. And Mae Thai on Mariatorget was great! We would gladly stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was super clean and everything was prepared for our stay! The communication was good. Thanks for having us and being so flexible with the check in and check out times :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Light, airy, stylish apartment in a good location (not central but walkable distance from train station). Great value for families.\nThank you for a great stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice walking tour in DC including some neat architecture and design history. The history was kind of more about the people and the circumstances of the architecture and construction of the building than it was actually about architectural designs or specifications. Neat tour. Learned some new facts and names about DC history and construction. I think I was expecting more about the layout and design of the city but this focuses more on a few buildings. Sam did a good job on his monologues but still seemed new to the questions that were asked occasionally. He would do his best to answer but it sometimes felt like he was blindly shooting from the hip. Really nice guide, though. Very personable and easy to communicate with. Our tour went a little longer than 2 hours but I was happy with that. To conclude in 2 hours would have felt like we were cutting out facts or locations. It didn’t feel rushed which was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is extremely nice. He is very tidy. You can tell he is the kind of person who cleans up after himself after everything he does.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is in a great location. I walked everywhere:\r\n* From T-Centralen 30 minutes\r\n* To Gamla Stan 25 minutes\r\n* To Djurgården 20 minutes.\r\n* National musset, Modernamuseet: 20 minutes\r\nBut if you want to take the metro, the station is right outside the entrance to the apartment complex.\r\n\r\nEdwin will meet you in Karlaplan and take you to his place if you have trouble finding it. Because it's so close to Karlaplan (I call it the circle garden), it's easy to find your way home with a map. It's like the center of Ostermalm and many streets lead straight to it.\r\n\r\nI felt very safe. You need at least 3 keys just to get in (4 if he's not home). The neighborhood feels very safe too.\r\n\r\nInside is very modern and clean. Maybe this will describe it enough: When you lock the door to the bathroom, the outside handle glows red to let the outside know there is someone in there. The shower is clever and space-saving. It's made of 2 glass doors that swing open to form a box. When you're done, they swing towards the wall so there's more room. Although, I thought the bathroom was plenty spacious anyway.\r\n\r\nThere's a Fruit/vegetable stand outside along with a small street vendor that sells fast food, and a McDonald's. But if you are serious about buying groceries, Edwin will tell you where you can get them cheaper.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the street view here. That's the back part. The front, where you will most likely always come from, is very nice.\r\n\r\nIt's very quiet even though you are above a major street. At night, it is almost dead silent. And the room has a double-paned window and a blackout shade. It is annoying, however, when it rains because you can hear the loud rain droplets hit the sill. If that bothers you, bring ear plugs. I usually fall asleep very easily, and the sound kept me up.\r\n\r\nThere is a place to do laundry downstairs, but you have to get Edwin to reserve it ahead of time.\r\n\r\nIn terms of tourist advice, I didn't get much from him. So don't rely on him for the best places to eat. I didn't ask, but I doubt he's exactly the local expert I would hope for in terms of things to do either. He's Bolivian, but has been in Stockholm for many years. He'll give you a map, but that's the best information I could get from him. The places I listed above were good enough for me.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I really enjoyed staying at Edwin's place in Stockholm. Edwin is friendly and his apartment is very clean. The room had a very comfortable bed and was quiet. The location is good - we walked all around Stockholm from the apartment but there is also public transport close by. I would definitely recommend staying with Edwin. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin was a great communicator and even met us at the metro stop to help us find his place. Good local knowledge, giving us some great restaurant advice & transport tips. He even lent me a laptop while mine was being repaired!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is very well located with excellent rail and bus connections, and within walking distance of central Stockholm. The apartment was absolutely spotless and the facilites were all as listed.\r\n\r\nI definitely recommend staying with Edwin if you're coming through Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Edwin's flat is even more lovely and cute that pictures show. The room is quite spacious and the bed really comfortable for two persons. It is also well communicated by public transport (in fact, the metro station is in front of the flat) and very close to the downtown (5 minutes walk). Every room of the flat is absolutely clean and the kitchen is amazing, you can use any tool or device you want. \r\n\r\nEdwin is really kind and helpful as well. He gave us good information about the city, museums, transportation... He speaks Swedish, English, Spanish and Russian. He let you feel utterly free inside the flat. \r\n\r\nVery good experience. Don't hesitate to be hosted by Edwin!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is a very kind and helpfull host. There was no problem in communication. Apartment itself is really clean and cozy. Large bathroom, kitchen and absolutely everything you need. Very central location. Even thou I only spend there one night it was really good one. Definitely would suggest this apartment to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our stay at Edwin's apartment was excellent. The apartment is very clean and perfectly located - 1 minute from the subway station and within the walking distance to the majority of the sightseeing spots. Edwin is a great host. He is very friendly and helpful, speaks several languages fluently. We would definitely recommend his apartment to stay at. When we are in Stockholm next time, we will stay there for sure. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin provide very clean room with all we need. Shower, kitchen include and vary comfortable.

He advised good cafe and interesting musems. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The  two night stay at Edwin was very nice. He's a welcoming and helpful host. He also gave good info on the museums.\r\nI just used the Metro twice: to arrive and to depart. I walked the rest (in the snow!).    February 2013</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This is my second experience with Airbnb, and Edwin could have not been a better host. He was always extremely eager to help. He speaks 4 languages fluently, and we really had a great time chatting with him. He also made excellent recommendations on what to sight see and also where to eat. \r\nThe pictures do not really do justice to the apartment. It is much better than what appears on them. It has a lot of light and it is, one of the most important items for me at least, really really clean.\r\nWe recommend staying at Edwin's and we will do it when we go back to Stockholm for sure.\r\nThanks for the really nice stay, Edwin!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed in Edwin's apartment for one night.

The Tallink ferry terminal is just one metro stop away. Edwin suggested  a local restaurant that was so good we went there twice.  We do recommend you stay with Edwin when in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin has an exceptionally clean apartment in a good part of Stockholm; an easy walk down to the waterfront and ~20minutes walk to Central Station. There is a supermarket (and other shops) downstairs in the apartment block.

Grocery, cafe, restaurants, and shopping available on the first floor of the build with others nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin was an excellent host and provided me with a very comfortable stay. His home is located very near public transportation, making it easy to get anywhere in the city. He was also very eager to help me enjoy my visit to the fullest, and made the effort to be as conveniently reachable for me in the event I needed anything at all. I would certainly stay here again.\r\n\r\nCheers,</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had one night in Edwins apartment and it was really great. It's located quite good (underground in 2 minutes, bikes can also be borrowed), so you can walk to most of the sightseeing highlights of Stockholm. The Vasa museum is only 15 minutes walk away and if you don't mind walking you can also reach any other things. Edwin is a very nice host, he had maps he gave us and explained everything very well. We could use everything in his apartment and he even had towls for us. The kitchen had everything you needed. The internet also worked very good as Edwin also uses it quite often ;)!\r\nWe can really recommand this apartment, it is perfect for tqo people wanting to do some sightseeing in Stockholm!\r\nWe'll probably come back next year! :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin was a  very good anfitrion.He told me about the city and gave me all the information even the airport indications, transports and taxis.His flat is located eassy to walk around the city.It was clean and confortable: the room, the bathroon and the kitchen.\r\nI recommend you this accommodation city center.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin was incredibly helpful to us during these few days.

He is a very kind and friendly host. He provided me promptly  with all the information I needed, in order to reach his address. His flat is located in a very convenient area, with immediate access to a tube station and hence easily connected with the center of Stockholm. His flat has been recently refurbished with a modern style and is clean and welcoming. The bedroom is spacious and tidy. The materass is very comfortable - well done on that Edwin! I had a good rest, after a long day of business meetings in town. The bathroom was clean and convenient. I did not take advantage of the living room or the kitchen, as I arrived a bit late in the evening, but they are equally tidy. The next day I left the flat, and Edwin had gone to work already. Overall I had a good stay and will probably stay again at Edwin's next time I come to Stockholm. Definitely recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is a very good host.His apartment is very wonderful and location is very good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin's place is perfectly located not far from central Stockholm near many shops and the metro station. The room itself was great for a couple, and the apartment was very clean and tidy. Edwin was a great host, very friendly and welcoming, and told us all the good local places to go. We didn't see much of him as we were out all the time, but would definitely recommend his place and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had a brilliant time with Edwin and his wife (who didn't speak English, but Edwin's English was more than enough). He was a lovely, kind and generous host. He helped with any questions we had about local sights and getting around. I highly recommend getting the Stockholm card which gives you free access to public transport and entry into 80+ museums and attractions including boat canal tours, history museums etc. Highly recommend Vassa museum, containing the only ship recovered from the 17th century. Also the Skansen outdoor museum is amazing. Edwin will provide a lot of info. He and his wife were not around much and we could use the kitchen, bathroom and living room to our convenience. Would highly recommend this accommodation. Super close to train, really close to city and easy to walk around too. Enjoy - 10/10!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The best way to let my fellow Airb&brs know of my experience with Edwin is to say:  I'll be back.  \r\n\r\nThis was my first experience with Airb&b and it was excellent.  VERY EASY.  Edwin and his wife are VERY clean.  The bed is EXCELLENT.  Absolutely no problems.\r\n\r\nMy highest recommendation.  Value for money is EXCELLENT!  (How will hotels survive AirB&B?)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin was very accommodating And friendly. The room was exactly as described, clean and tidy. The location was 2 metro stations away from  the Central Station. Neighborhood was very good. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is a good host.

Edwin is very nice host. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is a great host, we felt comfortable in his apartment.\r\nThe location is good, in the calm part of the city, but with all necessary right at hand (shopping mall on the ground floor). 20 minutes of calm walk to the city center, same amount of time in other direction to the ferry.\r\nThe apartment is extremely clean, the bed is comfy, and we used the kitchen too, it contains everything needed for big cooking or just heating up.\r\nThere is also a drawer and shelfs in the room, which I found very useful.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice room in a big bright and very clean appartment. Bed is good, internet is fast, bathroom is just near the bedroom, and Edwin is very nice! He was very reactive to emails to give me all the information before my arrival, everything went well. 20 min walking to city center / metro station is in front of the building and only 2 stations away from central station, supermarket is downstairs, there is an elevator  in the building, and neighborhood is nice and quiet. Very good stay!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is extremely friendly, helpful, has sent me a very well detailed description of how to get from the airport to the central station and from the station to his place, including all possibilities. The room, the bathroom and the kitchen are clean and as described.\r\nThe appartment is 25/30 minutes walk from the central station which makes it a good starting point to visit Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is the best host.\nHe is gentle and nice.\nI liked his quick answers.\nThe house is also perfect!\nWe had a good time in Stockholm.\nThank you. Edwin ^^</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin made us feel very welcome and recommended an excellent place for dinner. The room is exactly as it looks and the bathroom is also nice with a good shower (toilet's a bit close to the sink haha! ) \r\nCouldn't be more convenient for shops as it is above a shopping mall. \r\nVery easy to get to from and Edwin was very helpful with directions from airport etc. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin was an excellent host, and his place is incredibly nice and clean.  He was very understanding even though we showed up kind of late because of travel delays, and his place is in a great location.  There is a huge shopping mall on the ground floor, and there's a metro station right outside, although you can walk to most places.  I would definitely stay at Edwin's place again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin was perfect in his instructions on how to reach the apartment and we had a really warm welcome. The description of the apartment is absolutely accurate and the neighbourhood was really nice with respect to connectivity to all tourist places and the city center via bus/metro. The apartment is very clean and tidy and the kitchen was fully equipped to cook your own food. One thing which we did not like was the flexible checkout time which was mentioned in the description. We reached at around 7PM and we had our return, the next day at 7PM. So, we were told (a bit rudely!) that we can keep our luggage outside the room after 11AM but we should not be in the house after 12PM, as they were expecting another guest and they did not want many people in the house. Also there was a bit of language problem (English) speaking with them and that made it a bit uncomfortable. Uncomfortably, we kept our luggage there till 5PM and then we came back, picked it up and left. Apart from this, everything was good.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin and his wife were excellent hosts. Extremely friendly and helpful. The room was immaculately clean and convenient. It is very easy to get anywhere I the city from here (walking or public transit!) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is very lovely and is very close to city center, a shopping center is just downstairs so you can just do as at home! Edwin is a very kind person and he will prepare everything that you need. The place is also very quiet to have a good sleep!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The overall experiences was very positive. Edwin always responded quickly to my questions. Make sure to follow the directions he sends to you exactly otherwise you will have a difficult time finding the apartment. He was pretty straight forward with very little small talk. Edwin provided information about Sweden, but it would have been nice to learn more about him.  Otherwise he was a good host. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great location and amazing city! Walkable to most museums and old town</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thank you, Edwin & Ladiya! Everything was great!\r\nCommunication with Edwin was easy and he always replied fast and very informative.\r\nHe gave me very good description how to find his apartment and also enough tips about Stockholm.\r\nI felt very welcomed during my stay. The location is also perfect! It is very close to downtown area. And I could get easily to all the attractions by walk. The apartment has everything you need. I definitely recommend it!\r\ncheers//</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very clean, warm, comfortable room. And we arrive very late than expected because of the heavy snow but still get a very warm welcome by Edwin. It is a very good experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Really nice stay, close to trains. The room is clean and comfortable and it's quite a good value.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin is very nice and considerate. He explained the details of transportation before we arrived, and recommended some good tourist spots in the Stockholm city. His  place is very cosy and clean, with all the kitchen equipments you need. The location is perfectly convenient, only takes 3mins to the metro station. It's definitely a great choice to stay at Edwin's place when visiting Stockholm city.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Edwin is an amazing host.

Would definitely recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Super clean place! Very central to most of the attractions and the best thing of all is it is above two big supermarkets and a shopping mall! Bed is very comfortable. Maybe a little noisy while sleeping at night as it is next to the main road, but it is super good location next to the train station. Would highly recommend all guests to stay when visiting Stockholm! \n\nEdwin was very friendly and accomodating as he waited for us till late to receive us. Very clear check-in instructions and Edwin is willing to take time to share with us on directions and attractions around the area! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>A quiet and amazing stay.  There are shops all around and close to public transit as well.  The place was warm and clean.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The room is in an excellent location and within walking distance of the Royal Palace and the main museums in Stockholm. It is located extremely close to a shopping center, restaurants, and fast food locations. Edwin was very helpful during my stay, and he even went as far as to pick me up from the Arlanda Express train station to make me feel safe. He is an excellent host and I highly recommend him to anyone looking at staying in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a good experience. Very comfortable bed and a clean room. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a very nice stay at Edwin's place, and I can certainly recommend it to other guests!\n\nI arrived really late due to a delayed flight, and Edwin was so kind to stay up late just for me. The communication beforehand was very detailed; I had no problems finding my way to his flat and around the building. The room is bright, tidy and comfortable, and the whole flat is very clean and convenient. \n\nThe location is great - there are just two stops by metro to the main station (where the airport bus also stops). Stockholm is a fairly small town, so you can easily walk to the main attractions, but different transport modes are within easy reach of the apartment. It is also located on top of a small mall, so you can shop for groceries within 30 seconds of leaving the flat. Shops and restaurants are also around the corner, as is a small market at the weekend.\n\nAll in all, it is a very good place to stay when in Stockholm, with Edwin being very considerate and helpful. Thank you again, Edwin! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Edwin is an excellent host as he's so knowledgable.

The room was lovely and warm, a comfy bed and a great shower. All the amenities needed.

Ubicación muy céntrica, lo que nos ayudó a descubrir la ciudad sin perder mucho tiempo en desplazamientos (tanto la estación de bicicletas “City Bikes” como el metro “Karlaplan” están a pocos pasos de la puerta del edificio –y a sólo 2 paradas/5 minutos en metro de la estación central de Estocolmo-). Además hay un supermercado, restaurantes y cafeterías en el centro comercial de la planta baja del edificio. Edwin fue un anfitrión muy simpático a la vez que muy discreto. Recomendaría sin lugar a duda este alojamiento. \n**FRA** Appartement très calme, bien équipé pour un court séjour à Stockholm et situé dans une résidence close et aménagée d’agréables jardins. Sa localisation est très bonne, ce qui nous permit de découvrir la ville sans perdre trop de temps en déplacements (la borne de vélos ”City Bikes » comme la bouche de métro ”Karlaplan” se trouvent à quelques mètres à peine de la porte de la résidence –et à seulement 2 stations/5mn de la gare principale T-Centralen). En outre, il y a un supermarché, des restaurants et cafés dans le centre commercial du rez-de-chaussée de la résidence. Edwin fut un hôte très sympathique et discret à la fois. Je recommande vivement cet appartement.\n**ENG** Very quiet and well-equipped apartment in a gated community with nice gardens; ideal for a short stay at Stockholm. Its location is very good to discover the town: the “City Bikes” station and the “Karlaplan” subway station are only few steps ahead from the door of the residence. The “T-Centralen” railway station is only 2 stops/5 minutes away by subway. There is a supermarket, some restaurants and cafés in the shopping center of the ground floor of the apartment building.

I recommend it as a good choice of accommodation.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We made a very pleasant stop at Edwin's. The apartment is superb and very well placed. We were able to find space to park our car. On Edwin's wise advice we were able to make a brief discovery of a Stockolm district a stone's throw from his home. Our stopover was short because we had our ferry early the next day but we keep a very good memory.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edwin was a great host. Friendly, helpful and welcoming he was happy to chat but was otherwise unobtrusive. The flat was quiet and peaceful, the bed comfortable, the shower perfectly clean and we were able to use his kitchen and lounge.

When we arrived, he greeted us and provided plenty of directions and suggestions. But then he gave us our privacy. The room was very clean and bigger than we expected. More than enough room for me and my wife. Also, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean but the shower is complicated to use. Basically, we got water all over the bathroom floor every time we used it. It requires a few minutes of clean up afterward. The apartment's location is amazing. It's in a lovely, safe neighborhood. Only two blocks from Djorrtingham, which is the main pedestrian road with shops and restaurants. Only 20 minute walk to Gamilstan, where you find the royal palace. Honestly, we walked everywhere and only used public transportation to get to and from the airport. Never had to call a cab. We would absolutely recommend Karl's place and would definitely stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl is a very kindle host and a nice person!\r\nHe send us all the direction to reach his home, and gave us good recomendations to stay in stockholm.\r\nThe apartment was clean and  very cozy, even if it could be an accomodation for few days, because has been obtained from his own home. there is also a little kitchen, and Karl offers its guests also coffee and tea for breakfast.\r\nMoreover the position is really central! simple to reach from the central station and also close to the old city and to a metro station.\r\nReally Good!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl was a great host. He kept good contact leading up to our trip and clear instruction on how to find his place. Apartment is as pictured: small but easily slept two people for 3 nights. Quiet and clean. Wifi helped us plan our stay in Stockholm. Within walking distance of central city and T-bana. Would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl and Karin were great host. Apartment was perfectly clean, neat and sunny. They left water for us in the minifridge. Room is small but with all the things you need. A good bed, nice sofa, a desk and space for hanging clothes. A separate small area where you can find a microwave, small fridge, and a heater for a morning tea. Bathroom was small but nice. After you showered you have to dry the floor but that was not a problem for us. Location is perfect. Building has an elevator that is helpfull when you have heavy luggage. We definetely recommend this apartment. Thanks Karl and Karin!!! We had a great time in Stockholm. Chris and Walter.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We were in Stockholm for only 3 days. Karl was really helpful, he provided very clear instructions about how to commute from the airport to the apartment.\r\nThe flat is really clean, the location is amazing, only 10 minutes walk from the center!\r\nKarl is really friendly, the flat is furnished with a TV, private bathroom and a small kitchen.\r\nWe had an amazing time!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time in Stockholm.

Location - just perfect. \r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We found this a great location - very central but a quiet and attractive neighbourhood. We liked the old, charming, and well maintained Stockholm building that the apartment is in. The main room is a good size. Kitchen and bathroom are small but ok for a short stay. Karl is very nice, was respectful of our privacy and very helpful with local information and suggestions.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Wonderful experience!  Karl was a great host, giving us some good 'insider' tips, providing a map for our usage, and letting us arrive early on a Sunday morning.  The apartment has everything you could need - tea and coffee, hair dryer, and even an iron!  The bed was the comfiest I slept in during my 2-week trip.  Spotlessly clean.  Neighborhood was very cozy and just next to the main shopping drag.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karl provided comprehensive pre-trip information, and a cheerful welcome when we arrived at the apartment. The apartment is ideal if you are looking for a characterful experience of staying in Stockholm for a few days. The shower layout is an interesting novelty, but Karl explained the reason and it just added to the character of staying in an older traditional Stockholm apartment. Location and access to must see attractions is excellent, and overall the accommodation, and amenities contributed towards the enjoyment of our stay. Don't miss out on seeing Stockholm's Town Hall. Very impressive! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My boyfriend and I were in September in Karl's flat. \nWe got a kind welcome from Karl, he was very helpful with his explanation of the city and all his recommendations. He was flexible to check in (we arrived at 20.30)\nÖstermalms Saluhall was amazing!\nAnd.... how many languages do you speak Karl???!!!\n\nThe room was nice and clean and with a mini room as a kitchen and useful bathroom even if the shower was not much uncomfortable. There are wifi.\n\nThe best advantage of the flat is its localization, very close to the city center, the main commercial street and the central station of Tbane and trains. (10min)\n\nHighly recommended!  \nIf we will go again to Stockholm, we will repeat!.\nThanks Karl! :)</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Chambre avec un petit coin cuisine, centrale  et très calme.\r\nKarl est très sympathique et parle français. Ces quelques recommandations sur les lieux à visiter se sont toutes révélées excellentes.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very kind and helpful host. Location perfect, quite central. Space good, all you need for one or two people. Lovely old building.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl is a really nice owner, the apartment is not very big, but really comfortable, everything you need is inside. Very good place to stay in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our host, Karl, was very helpful, giving us lots of information before we arrived and in getting us settled in when we did arrive, and the apartment was just as pictured. The neighborhood was lovely and right near many shops and restaurants; a two block walk led to a beautiful park with fountains and statue of Strindberg. As many reviewers have noted, the shower arrangement in the bathroom is a bit weird, but workable if you don't mind squeegeeing the floor after your shower. I found the very soft, thin mattress very uncomfortable because it offered no back support, but my husband slept just fine. There was instant coffee and tea in the kitchenette, but with terrific cafes so near, we didn't use either. There was a hairdryer provided too, but there was no place to plug it in in the bathroom (and the mirror in there was too high for me to see myself anyway); it could have been plugged in the kitchen, but that had no mirror either. So I ended up drying my hair at the desk in the picture, using the mirror that was about 16 feet away - not a good setup. I'd recommend this accommodation for someone with a good back who doesn't have to use a mirror much. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The host was very nice and helpful and the location was excellent, centrally located.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"As many have discovered before me, this is a great place to stay -- good bed, clean, compact, wi-fi and TV, perfectly located in the heart of the city.  To the previous comments, I would add my particular appreciation for the approach to this apartment dating back to 1884 -- either via open cage elevator, or via stone stairs that curve gracefully around it, lighted by windows from an interior courtyard.  The separate entrance from the hallway, shielded by both inner and outer doors, makes me guess this space was once servants' quarters.  The building is located one block from August Strindberg's last residence, and a stay here is like stepping onto the set of one of his plays, or Ibsen's, or Ingmar Bergman's \"\"Fanny and Alexander.\"\"  How many times can you do that?\"</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl's apartment was good for a solo traveler. The location was close to public transit and nearby to several restaurants.   Both he and his wife were responsive and communicative and made sure that we connected prior to my arrival. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl is a perfect host - he gave me detailed info about the city and let me stay later than the official check out time. The apartment has a very good location - just next to the metro but really you can reach almost all tourist attraction on foot and Stockholm worth it for sure. Apartment is small but cozy. There is a reparation in the building as it is 18th century and window was covered with the paper - but I was coming to the room only to sleep so ho problems. Would definitely come back again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The communication with Karl before my trip and upon arrival was great, he was very helpful and gave me a few very useful tips. He speaks very good Spanish!\r\nThe room/apartment was much better than I expected and was perfect for my intentions: have a place to crash at night. \r\nThe shower is mini, but it is OK, although it is uncomfortable to drain the water after each shower. \r\nEverything else great: the bed, the kitchenette, the bathroom, there was even a TV! Perfectly located. \r\nGracias Karl!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Karl was an amazing host. Very friendly and helpful…the flat was ideal for a small stay and for a couple. Good situation near the shopping street. \r\nTo recommand!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had a very nice stay at this place. For my purposes, the location is excellent and it feels safe. The host was very welcoming and explained everything well. He also provided a very good description on how to find the place. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Perfect location! Building And room have a lovely charm and Karl provided excellent restaurant recommendations:)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Karl's pre trip communication helpful as was when he provided a key to the flat  He also provided some insight/recommendations for places to see and eat. The location is pretty good;  10 minutes from bus or train stations,  near shopping,  old city,  ferries are all 20 to 30 minutes away by foot. \r\nThe place is very, very basic. \r\nThe only issue was the bathroom. The place was built in the late 1890s or so so there are limits to any renovation you can do. The place is an \"\"apartment\"\" only because it has a separate entry way from the main suite (the doors to the main suite in the place still exist) to the main foyer entry.   It is a one room--former bedroom-- place with a two piece bath and a poorly designed third piece as a \"\"shower\"\"  which is not enclosed in the bathroom. This is not uncommon however the bathroom floor ends up with water standing on the floor as the drain top sits above the floor/water level. These means you need to squeegee the water off the floor and into the drain every time you shower or you step in water every time you go into the bathroom. \r</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good,very good place</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl is very nice! He welcomed us very well and gave us very good tips on the city!\r\nThe apartment is pretty little (an annex of Karl's one) but comfy and  located very close to the city center, in an old building.\r\nWe had a perfect stay there even if the shower is not very practicle...\r\n </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good communication beforehand, perfect location </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Karl was great host and he gave us excellent advice regarding Stockholm. The apartment is in an excellent location, main street being 2 minutes walk away.\n\nOnly thing you need to get used to is the scandinavic shower, but Karl said he's in the process of putting a new, \"\"classic\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We really loved our stay at Karl's studio flat. Karl has been an excellent host. He showed us around the studio flat, provided extra towels for our little one and was very friendly and helpful. The studio flat itself was clean and comfortable and its location superb as it's literally in the heart of Stockholm. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We passed an excellent week-end to Stockholm. The flat of Karl is perfect for one person or a couple. It is situanted in very good area, we did not use the transport at all. We discoverd the city by foot. Karl is  kindly and prevenant host. He advice us a pub with live jazy soul music (the stampen) and we passed a pretty night. \nNB: Karl parle très bien français ! \nAlice & Clement </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lovely little flat in an excellent location in Stockholm. Really close to the Rådmasgatan T station on the green line as well as several supermarkets, pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants. Karl was welcoming and kind. There were only two minor inconveniences (which were not a big deal and I guess I wasn't paying great attention to the pictures): one was that the little kitchenette had no sink and the second was that the shower is constructed without a floor that slopes down to the drain, so you have to use a window scraper to get the water off of the floor and into the drain (the curtain doesn't really stretch, so it doesn't give much coverage). I only stayed 2 nights, so these factors were not a huge inconvenience. The other thing is that I wish I had been notified that there would be construction going on in the building (the hammering on the landing started at around 7:30 am each morning). Again, not a deal breaker, just wish I had been able to take into consideration when choosing where to stay. \r\n\r\nOverall, comfortable bed, lovely location, but with a few inconveniences and slow wifi.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Very lovely little studio flat. Good sized bedroom with a shower room and small kitchenette in excellent location close to city centre and shops. Karl was very good at communicating with us beforehand and arrival on the day was easy. Flat is clean, nicely decorated and well equipped. Items such as shampoo, hairdryer, fridge and microwave were very useful but kitchen not really suitable for making anything substantial. \r\n\r\nOnly suggestion I would make is that the shower doesn't really work too well. It is a wet room but the water goes everywhere and is a bit difficult to properly shower.  However, we were only staying for a couple of nights so wasn't too much of an issue. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Karl's apartment is located in the middle of Stockholms heart. Only one street away from the main shopping street and 10 minutes walking from the central station.\r\nThe communication with Karl was very good. He answered fast. After our arriving, he explained us every thing which we needed to know about the place. Furthermore, Karl gave us a map and a short introduction about where to find what in Stockholm.\r\nThe apartment is very simple and smaller than it looks on the pictures. The \"\"kitchen\"\" has a small fridge</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice friendly helpful host. Clean and tidy apartment in a lovely building with all the necessary amenities. The location is excellent within walking distance to old town and main shopping area, and Rådmansgatan train station is only a few minutes away. Wireless internet was also perfect.\r\nKarl lives right next door, which makes it easy to attend to any issues or queries.\r\nSee you next time! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed at Karl's flat during two nights. It was a really nice stay. He was very welcoming and he gave us a lot of good indications for our short stay. The place was really clean, everything that we could need was there. It's close to central station and to the old city so if you don't want to take the metro during your stay this is the place to be.\nWe would go there again if we get the chance to go again in Stockholm.\nThank you for everything Karl. :)\nPs: for the French people, malgré ce que peut dire Karl, il parle très très bien français !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl was extremely welcoming, showing me around the space and also key places on the map. The flat is in a short walking distance of the centre and the neighbourhood was quiet.\r\nOverall a good place to stay - however if you are hoping to make any food, the kitchenette is basic with no sink and no surface to prepare food (I used the desk in the bedroom). Also Karl mentioned he is hoping to install a shower cubicle which will be a great addition as currently the arrangement means the bathroom floor gets a bit like a swimming pool when you use the shower.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The studio is in a great location.  It was easy to get around the city using public transit.  There were food stores and restaurant nearby.  Karl is an excellent host and spent time telling about the studio and answering questions.  It quickly fixed an item that broke ... we told him about it in a morning email and it was fixed when we returned from a day of sightseeing.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great studio flat in a good location for exploring Stockholm. Everything walkable but hiring the city bikes made for a cool mode of transport! Karl was really helpful - recommended. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl received us upon our arrival and gave us a very good orientation of Stockholm and the popular sights. He also gave us a map with the popular sights marked out.\r\n\r\nAs we rented a car during our stay, Karl also patiently brought us around the neighbourhood to explain how the parking system works in Stockholm and where we can park, as we do not understand the Swedish language. \r\n\r\nWe were intrigued by how the lift system works in the old building - something we don't have in our country anymore!\r\n\r\nAs we had 2 huge luggages, the space was a big tight for us. However, the location of the apartment made up for everything!! the shopping district was nearby - probably just 2 streets away.\r\n\r\n Karl was a great host and we had a great experience!\r\n\r\n </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karl is such a lovely host and an excellent communicator who would go out of his way to help you, the location of the room is second to none and we couldn't have found a better spot, we needed an iron and Karl was great in providing us with one asap. my only comments would be the size of the room and the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThe room is small so if you are traveling with someone you don't know well then it's not the one for you. It's a small room and not a studio which makes it cosy.\r\n\r\nThe toilet is very small and doesn't have a shower space, there is a metal provider which you can use to limit the water going everywhere but sadly it's not the most efficient and you still end up with a very wet toilet floor which you would need to sweep using a small hand sweeper which means you have to bend to sweep the floor which was difficult for me as I have a bad back. \r\n\r\nThe building is an amazing building from 1930s I believe but this means that the drains are not the best which translated into our room constantly smelling badly from the toilet drains. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl was a very friendly and helpful host. The apartment was small but very clean and central, easily in walking distance to all the sights. Only negative was the shower, which was a little basic, but the listing was good value and well recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our host Karl was wonderful! He was very quick to respond to any questions we had leading up to our stay and throughout our stay as well. Very accomodating, well heated and equipped with complimentary coffee/tea. Cozy apartment for 1-2 persons. Karl answered had excellent english (helpful for we are Australian and spoke next to no Swedish!) all of our questions about the area and Stockholm itself, also provided us with a map. In a great location so close to shops and walking distance to Gamla Stan, and the building is with lift. Would recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Il n'y pas vraiment de baignoire ou de bac à douche. L'évacuation de l'eau se fait à même le sol. À part ce petit défaut, l'appartement est idéalement situé, Karl et sa compagne sont chaleureux et disponibles. Nous avons passé un excellent week-end.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had a lovely stay at Karl’s place in Stockholm. The location is perfect and very close to everywhere you need to go. It’s just minutes’ walk to the central station where you can find an amazing food hall!\nThe apartment is very cozy and inside a lovely traditional Swedish building. Karl was away while we were there but his wife Karin took good care of us!\nWe would recommend this place to everyone who is visiting Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl's wife had greeted us and given the keys; she was very friendly, extremely welcoming, and willing to answer any questions. The location is close to one of the train stops and very good bars are all within walking distance. Karl has Stockholm travel information in the desk drawers, at your convenience. Great stay and right in City Center. Would definitely recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good position, only 10 minutes by walking to reach the central station. The apartment is cozy and comfortable. It has all the necessary, also a very useful kitchen. The shower is pretty problematic because it is opened.\nThe host is willing, friendly and speaks Italian fluently. I would really recommend this place. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, good communication and hospitality.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I initially hesitated to book Karl's studio because of the strict cancellation policy, but I'm so glad I chose to stay here. First, the price/value of this place is hard to beat. Second, Karl is totally professional in everything he does: he is very responsive to communications, his place is clean, and he does a very good job orienting you to the studio and Stockholm. Specific to my stay, Karl helped me reserve time to use the building laundry room and made sure I was comfortable using the machines. He was also flexible with check-in (early) and check-out (holding my bag for the day). The bed is comfortable, I had no issues with the shower, and the location is fantastic. I would absolutely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great location in easy walking distance to most attractions and very close  to public transport. We enjoyed our stay here very much and Karl J was a great host with excellent communication that made the experience even more pleasurable.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Superb location within Stockholm, in an 18th-century house. Karl also was a very gracious host and even went to the trouble of coming down to the street to welcome me. The apartment was very clean and functional, with everything as described, but cooking something would be a minor challenge, as kitchen section and bathroom are very small. The shower is \"\"nordic\"\" indeed (good water pressure and temperature</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Karl was amazing, made sure we were well informed of what the city had to offer and made sure we knew the way around town. 10/10</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location very close to town. There is a station literally 3 mins walking distance. \n\nThe place is clean and tidy.\n\nOnly thing I can give a heads up on is the host lives next door and the apartment is basically attached to his. Seems like it was once all one apartment and was renovated. There's not much space but is generally good. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was a very convenient place to stay. Location is excellent.\nExcellent laundry included in tariff.\nThe unit has a separate entrance, the bedroom/ living room is combined with a desk and 2 chairs. The shower is only just adequate as is the kitchen.\nIt was very clean, the host was friendly and most obliging</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karl was kind and nice.\nThe location is excellent.\nOne thing that I really felt terrible about this appartment is the bathroom, which we had to 'sweep' the water and mop the floor after shower.\nAfter shower, again got wet with the sweat!\nWondered why Karl didn't do something effective for the bathroom for the guests.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Small but convenient place, good for a day or two.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a great time in Stockholm! The room was in an excellent location and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you Karl</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Veeeeeeeeeery kind host, he'll help to make the journey wonderful. A good plac to stay in stockholm, near to the city center & the old town</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Karl's place is very good. It is in a lovely old apartment building right in the centre of town so is extremely convenient. The main room is a good size and very clean, and the kitchenette is handy. Karl himself was very nice.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karl’s place is located in an excellent location. We had a great time, communication was perfect!! I highly recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location - near Metro station and fun streets but very quiet.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The appartement is in a perfect location for enjoying the classic tourist program in Stockholm. We managed to see nearly all in a walking distance. \nIt‘s very quiet although, because it‘s just around the corner of the main streets and the window‘s go to the backyard.\nThe appartement it self is not big, but just perfect for a city trip. \nThere‘s everything you could need for your stay in Stockholm (even a small kitchen area).\nKarl is a great host, wrote back quick and had at the beginning great tipps for our stay in this amazing city.\nReally can recommend this appartement if you wanna be close to the main part of Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A really good host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Friendly host and a good location. The room was separated from  owners apartment and has own entrance. Sounds from main apartment could still be easily heard. The bathroom needs an urgent renovation. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>It was nothing but pleasure to stay at Karl's place. Check in was quick, location excellent, room well appointed with high ceilings and huge windows, privacy -100%. What more could guest ask for?</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Stayed in Karl's apartment for 2 nights in December and it was lovely. Well furnished, clean and just enough for 1-2 people. The location could not be better, very close to downtown Stockholm but you don't hear any noise from the downtown area which is a huge plus. Me and my friend liked the stay here and would book it again :) Karl and Karin were extremely nice! and good to have them just next door if there's anything.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>So many good things about the stay at Karl’s place! Quiet street, beautiful building, comfortable space (for one at least), Karl was responsive to email. Shower situation is a little awkward. Otherwise really enjoyed my visit.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Hosts were lovely and had very fast replies. Room exactly as advertised (although pictures don't capture the best angles), everything needed was there and couldn't find any area which was particularly dirty. Very good value for money considering the location and how easy it is to get to T-Central. Definitely would recommend to anyone planning a city break to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karl's room is just excellent for a quick trip to the city. I reckon it must be hard to find a better location (10 min walk from Tcentralen, 15-20 min walk from gamla Stan, with underground and buses connecting you to any point of the city). The area is full of supermarkets and convenience shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants so you will be sorted out for the whole trip. The place is small and set up like a hotel room, but elegantly decorated and the finishes are very nice. The room was very warm and comfortable, and the bed is a delight. There's no cooking facilities but you have a microwave, coffee maker and a small fridge. Also the host let some coffee, tea, water and snacks ready for me, very thoughtful. Also they didn't care and waited for me since I arrived beyond midnight to do my check in Only con of this flat would be the shower: is very messy and it takes you a while after to clean the bathroom, but I guess that's just the only way to make it fit, and once again is nothing major. Karl's place is just excellent if it's your first time in Stockholm and you're looking for making your trip easy going. Definitely would repeat.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Although a small space, it's perfect for 1-2 people. The location is excellent!  Only a 2 block walk to one of the main shopping and restaurant areas in the city. A 3 block walk from metro station as well. Very convenient.  Located in a quiet, beautiful building.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location with good access to public transit and plenty of restrictions nearby.  It is a cozy space in a nice building.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>What a great location for exploring Stockholm.  Hosts are attentive but not intrusive - the space is comfortable and tidy.  Metro is nearby but you can walk to the Royal Palace in about 20.   Remarkably quiet given that you're in the middle of the City and there are good restaurants and shops nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Cozy, well appointed space for a short stay in Stockholm. Everything is convenient in the flat and compact, a good value when looking for a place downtown.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location was amazing. It was clean and warm. All that I needed.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I truly enjoyed my stay at Karl's studio flat. It's clean, quiet, cozy and located in an amazing place on Norrmalm. It is in a parallel street to Drottninggatan, the long street which runs through the center of Stockholm down to Old town. Considering how expensive Stockholm can be, the studio apartment provides great value for money. It most suitable for one or two people (either for business or leisure) who are in Stockholm for a shorter stay. It is not suitable for travelers who wish to cook their own food as their is no stove (there is however a microwave and a filter coffee maker). I would recommend it and be very happy to stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice small flat. Excellent location within walking distance to grocery store, shopping, and restaurants. Our favorite place was Queens Head. It is a very short walk. Great pub with excellent food. We enjoyed our stay very much.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Excellent location. Comfortable room. Karin and her son, Gabriel were excellent hosts. They gave me some great tips, including restaurants and places to visit. If you plan to be in the flat during the day or evening, you should be aware that voices and movements (cooking, cleaning, etc.) in the rest of the flat are loud and clear from your room. This didn’t bother me at all, and I was pleased with my stay. I can’t say enough about the location-a couple of blocks from the metro and an easy walk to restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping. I walked to old town several times as well. Great place; I highly recommend!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was very nice, small but more than enough to explore the city and sleep very comfortably. The location is absolutely wonderful, it really could not be better. I walked everywhere and it is also near a lot of public transport. Karin left me great tips for local bars and restaurants and she is a very good host. Checking in and out could not have been easier. The building is also very beautiful and feels historic. If I return, I hope to stay there again. It was lovely!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This studio is an amazing location in Stockholm, very central and in walking distance to everything. The kitchenette has a fridge and microwave and you can buy groceries and wine from around the corner. Karin and Gabriel are amazing hosts, Karin waited up for me as my train was delayed by 7 hours and Gabriel checked in with me to make sure I could make my plane. They are both very lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Karin and her son Gabriel were amazing hosts! They were so sweet and made sure I was comfortable during my stay. I forgot a converter and Gabriel came right away to let me borrow his- a life saver! The apartment is in a great location & the bed is super cozy! Would highly reccommend and definitely stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I would highly recommend Karin's place for your stay during visiting Stockholm. Outstanding hospitality (Karin is absolutely wonderful), sparkling clean areas in the whole studio (couldn't even see a tiny spot of dust). The bed was great, good amenities and she provides both coffee and tea, clean towels and sheets. Couldn't be more satisfied. High standards for great price!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very stylish and cozy studio, really comfortable and nice for 1-2 person. There are even a good table, nice for work on your laptop, which is quite rare option in studios. Also like a huge window with nice curtains and vintage elevator in the building. Building is old but very clean and well maintained. Location is great - you can walk to central station or almost any of main sightseeing places and museums. Not far from many shops, including Lidl (literally 2 min. away) and Coop (the same). Karin is super friendly and nice; I came at night, and she still was awake to meet me and show everything.\n\nTwo moments I need to mention for travelers: there is no real kitchen, just small kitchenette (small fridge, microwave oven and electric kettle), so it's impossible to cook your own meal (which I prefer) - just to keep and heat ready meal from supermarket. Also there is no self check-in, you still need to meet host (Karin lives the next door to studio) to get keys, which is not very comfortable in the middle of the night or early morning.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karin was such a nice person and the location of the room was excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karin is a super host. Great place, comfortable, clean, super central and excellent communication.  Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Karin’s studio is in a great location. We ate at the restaurant across the street- Rolfs Kok. It was amazing! There were other great restaurants nearby and the metro is just a short walk away too.  The place is small, but if you are planning on being out exploring the city anyway that shouldn’t bother you much. The bathroom does get extremely wet after showering, which was slightly inconvenient, but manageable.  Overall a lovely place to stay and at a good price for Stockholm, which can be quite pricey.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Karin is an excellent host, welcoming and polite, and her place is beautifully clean, comfortable and restful.  The location is perfect, central yet quiet.  It is a beautiful place to stay, and everything you need is close by, including public transport to take you further afield, although I preferred to walk.  I highly recommend Karin’s place.  Thank you again Karin for a wonderful stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I highly recommend the place if you are looking for something cozy but not fancy! It’s clean, easy to find and in a very good location! I would stay there again in the future!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I had a great stay. Great location, excellent communication, and a comfortable and clean environment. Thank you and I hope to be back again sometime.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good location, lovely room, and kind host!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I highly recommend this place. It's a cozy central apartment near to everything. Karin and Gabriel are excellent hosts and you get answers in minutes. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Staying at Karin’s place was lovely. \nThe studio is very well equipped and perfectly located. Karin offers you an amazing guide with places and neighborhood to visit. \nI loved to have the possibility to use the laundry room. \nThe apartment is clean and cozy. \nHighly recommended :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We spend 7 days at Lina and Marcus' apartment and it was fantastic! The apartment is very nice, peaceful, clean and with a lot of light in every room! We liked very much the decoration, it was very modern and comfortable. We felt like home!\r\n\r\nIt was near the metro but we really didn't used even once because you could go walking almost everywhere (15min to the old town, Gamla Stan). The neighborhood was very nice also, with everything that we need very near (bar, restaurant, supermarket) and also it was kind of the old town architecture and very beautiful to walk (there was an amazing view point to Gamla Stan only 2min of the apartment)\r\n\r\nThey are very nice, very easy to contact and helpful with every needs that we had. They leave us an amazing map with recommendations like bars, shops and restaurants that was very helpful!\r\n\r\nIf we ever come back to Stockholm we would definitely stay in his apartment again! \r\n\r\nTotally recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was my first time using Airbnb and i was extremely happy with my stay at Lina and Marcus's apartment. Lina & Marcus are thoughtful friendly hosts with timely, excellent and efficient communication. They were very accommodating to our needs and provided us with detailed information about their apartment and the location. My family and I stayed at the apartment for four weeks and found it to be very comfortable, cosy and in a prime location. The apartment was extremely clean, neat and tidy. If ever I needed something they were a easily contactable. We would love to stay there again in the future. Thanks again</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lina is a great host. She always answered our questions very fast and gave us useful advice. Her apartment is very pleasant, clean and luminous. It also has a good location, near the shops (supermarkets, biological store) and the subway, in a very nice area, near Sofo and the old town. We recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lina and her partner were really helpful and the flat is amazing. We loved the area so much, we'd think about living there permanently if we had the choice. The flat is well situated, so convenient for shops, going out to eat and getting the metro.  I loved the fact we could run or walk to the beach on hot days! Lina was very accommodating and the flat really feels like home away from home.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This is a dream apartment in Stockholm! It is spacious and comfortable, and the decor is very stylish yet relaxed at the same time. We also loved the location. Sodermalm itself is a great neighborhood, and it's a pleasant walk from the apartment to Gamla Stan, the old town--or you can easily hop on the metro if you prefer. Lina was very kind and thoughtful; she made sure we had everything we might need for our stay. We had an amazing time in Stockholm, and wish we could have stayed longer in both that magical city and this wonderful apartment. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>I had a wonderful 2 week-long stay at Lina and Marcus' lovely flat.  Lina was great with her detailed and prompt communications, and even had some chocolate and wine for me when I arrived.  The flat itself is ideally located with easy access to both buses and T-bana (not to mention an amazing view from the kitchen window), and I loved spending time in their beautiful space as well as the neighborhood.  Lina and Marcus were kind enough to meet up with me during my stay and it was a real pleasure getting to know them.  It was the best kind of airbnb experience I could have hoped for and I look forward to returning to Stockholm!   </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We just got home from spending the most amazing week in Stockholm! Lina's flat was the perfect home for us while we were there. We love to cook and took advantage of her lovely kitchen. My boyfriend and I work remotely, and her main living room area offered the perfect environment to do so. The flat is conveniently located, only a few blocks from T-Bana and all of the restaurants, bars and shopping you could want. We were able to walk into Gamla Stan as well as all of the wonderful museums that Stockholm has to offer. You also won't want to miss the MOST AMAZING view of Stockholm located on a beautiful tree-lined walkway directly across from Lina's front door!\r\n\r\nI can't recommend Lina and her lovely home enough!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lina’s apartment was ideal for our visit to Stockholm. We found plenty of space, especially the living room. All the essentials are there for a comfortable accommodation including excellent wi-fi internet for checking on touring arrangements and keeping in touch with home. We did eat breakfasts and light dinners in the apartment. The kitchen was suitably equipped. We did eat our main meal at lunch to take advantage of the hearty lunch specials offered by many restaurants at reasonable prices. The location was also excellent for our needs. Nearby are many restaurants, cafes, and a large supermarket. However, the location is just far enough away to provide a quiet environment with Stockholm residents. The apartment was also very quiet. We walked to all the attractions in and near “Old Town” and used the water ferry to reach others, such as the Vasa Museum. Public transportation is also nearby as well as taxi service, which we should have used after a long day touring. Lina was very helpful before the departure, and she met us at the apartment and provided helpful suggestions and information. She was also available if we had questions, etc. She did help with a phone calling problem and taxi service to the airport. Highly recommended for travelers wanting to experience Stockholm and Sweden. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We really enjoyed our stay in Lina's beautiful apartment. Lina was very helpful and understanding when our arrival was delayed and gave us lots of great recommendations of things to see and do in Stockholm, including lots of excellent food recommendations.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lina is a great host and we had an amazing week in Stockholm. From the very beginning, Lina answered all messages quickly and she was always very nice and helpful. When we arrived, she also provided us with lots of helpful tipps what to do in Stockholm and gave us a map of the area around the apartment, where she had marked some interesting places for us. During our stay she got in touch with us again to find out if we needed anything else, which was also very nice. \r\nThe apartment is exactly as described and as shown in the pictures and it is beautiful, stylish and cosy, all at the same time. There is enough space for two people and you have everything you need there. Besides, the apartment is in a very hip neighbourhood with lots of things to do and see nearby. The old town and the modern city centre are also very close and so it never took us long to get anywhere. \r\nAll in all, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at such a great place again! :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lina's place is beautiful and adorable. I liked the brightness in the house, the colors and the space topped up with a convenient location. It has all the necessary things required for a comfortable stay. Lina is an very nice host. She was there to welcome me with her neat apartment. She was always in touch with me though on vacation and ensured I had a comfortable stay. She had a list to good to visit places around as well as some recommended resturants. Her collection of books on travel and living is awesome. Will recommend her house to all. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The apartment was clean, beautiful and spacey. I spent there a month and it was absolutely amazing time. Lina was excellent and helpful host. She gave us very useful tips for restaurants, shops and things to do in the area. We had a lovely stay. Would recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lina’s apartment is spacious, bright and decorated with lots of cool details, art and design. A very inspiring place in the best neighborhood and even with a good view. The communication has been easy. I would definitely recommend this place for others who appreciate art and design.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The location is excellent, there are lots of shops and stores nearby, and at walking distance to major attractions in the city. The apartment is very organized and clean. Communication was excellent and the host was always available to answer questions during the entire stay. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I spent 15 days in the very big room of the Mallika's apartment. The flat is located in Södermalm, one of the best neighborhood of Stockholm, full of life, with lots of cafe, restaurants and pubs. The house is 3 minutes far from the metro and the street is very calm and silent, even if you are 5 minutes walking from the coolest part of the city. \r\nThe apartment is really beautiful, with a kitchen fully equiped with everything you can need and the room is bright and spacious. I spent some days working home for my research and the place was perfect. \r\nMallika is the best owner you can meet! She is very nice and helpfull and full of good energy that make you fill home after 3 seconds. She helps me to find places in Stockholm and suggest me things to do in this wonderful city.\r\nI really loved to stay there!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\r\na nice host -\r\ngives good advise -</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, very central and really good for what we needed- lovely bedroom for a two night stay in town. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We were in town for the Stockholm Marathon. The location is simply perfectly located very close to a subway station. Easy to walk or cycle everywhere in the city if you feel like it. The apartment and the room you get is great, and Mallika helps you out with whatever you can think of. She's a good singer too, as she demonstrated in a live performance at one of the bars in Gamla Stan :-) She also helped us out when we had a minor medical problem on our flight to Stockholm.\r\n\r\nIn short, we had a great time. You should know though she has two cats, so if that bothers you, keep this in mind. It didn't bother us - we really didn't mind, nice animals!\r\n\r\nThanks again to Mallika for having us. Next time in Stockholm, we won't hesitate to come back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika was a great host and even helped us find a Vietnamese restaurant close by when we were craving pho. The room is huge and really nice. This is a perfect home base if you're visiting Stockholm. Close to a beautiful park and a good walk into the old town. Allergy sufferers: there are two kitties who are very sweet and can be kept out of the bedroom, though I felt bit allergic even when they were kept out. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The room description was correct and the room is nice and spacious. In a good location also. The host slept in the living room which made it a little uncomfortable for us to use the kitchen (had to walk through the lounge, while she was sleeping). Don't go here if you don't like cats. Unfortunately, the host left unclear instructions on how to obtain the keys. She knew our time of arrival (1am) but didn't keep an eye on her phone, so when I called several times to ask for the key location, I got no answer, resulting in us having to book a night in a nearby hotel. Communication was a big issue with the host. Trying to communicate about getting one night's fee back because we couldn't find the keys was impossible. She simply choose to ignore me, which is very disappointing. I didn't even get a reply to acknowledge that she had received my emails (regardless of whether she was or wasn't willing to pay me back). Just nothing. Therefore, I would not recommend staying with this host. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mallika a été une hôte parfaite. Très accueillante et attentive à notre séjour, je me suis senti comme chez moi dans la ravissante chambre mise à ma disposition. C'est une excellente adresse, très bien située. Ne pas hésiter à lui rendre visite !</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Had an amazing time here and the location was perfect. The apartment was beautiful and directions were very clear. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet the host but communication was very easy via text. We really enjoyed our time in Stockholm and definitely recommend this as a place to stay. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We spent a week there as part of a three-week trip around Sweden. The room was nice, spacious, quiet at night and with a comfortable double bed. It also has good storage and music speakers.\r\nThe kitchen and bathroom were well-equipped and easy to use.\r\nThe flat is well situated, close to metro station, restaurants, café's, parks and grocery store.\r\nMallika is an easy-going, kind and helpful host.\r\nWifi worked perfectly !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika's apartment is every bit as gorgeous as the photo's show. It is so easy to get to from the Mariatorget subway station and peaceful and quiet at night. \r\nThe room, and the whole apartment was spotlessly clean. Lovely fresh towels were provided and the wifi (being able to surf the net seems almost as important as being able to get a good nights sleep and get clean these days!!) worked perfectly.\r\nThe location is great as there is an excellent coffee shop on the corner and it is so easy to jump on the subway to get into town if you need to but as the weather was gorgeous, I had just a very lovely short stroll to Gamla Stan. \r\nMallika herself is a very lovely lady. Truely I could not have wished for a better host; friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and puts you immediately at ease. \r\nReally quick and excellent communication, whether it was by email or text message which made the pre-arrival experience smooth.\r\nI've had a wonderful weekend in Stockholm, thank you Mallika and your beautiful home for being a part of it! Sarah x</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything went very well. Will come back. Realy good value in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This place is great ! I love the aerea and Malike is super nice. You have a lot of the good coffe places of Stocholm very close and the underground and train, both is around the corner. I can definitly reccomend and I already look forward to come back in May. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed very comfortable at Malika's place, which is conveniently situated with good public transportation, both underground and train station that takes you to the Airport. We also enjoyed the walk and the view to the historical center of Stockholm. The use of the kitchen was perfect for our breakfast and even for a light dinner one of the evenings we spent at Malika`s</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a beautiful place in good location. Just be aware that is shared place with the host, Mallika. She actually lives and works in the living room. I stayed 3 days and at times it was  uncomfortable to be in the house.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This accommodation is very beautiful. Also location is close to metro station. So good!\nJust she likes quiet. We had to quiet. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great room in a wonderful location, very safe area. Easy walking distance to everything. Mallika was a good host and took the time to explain everything in the place and was generous in opening up her home for me to stay</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a really good time in Stockholm and in the appartement. It is a beautiful appartement, nice room and great location. Mallika is a nice person and was very helpfull.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>its a beautifull apparment in a very charming neighborhood. the room is huge and mallika&ramses (her cat) made us feel very welcome.good walking distance to all the main sights in stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We (Charlotte and Alina) had a wonderful stay at Mallikas place. The room is really comfy and looks exactely as it shows on the photo. Ramses is a really friendly and cute cat and Mallika was a great host!:)Thank you both for a good time!:)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice flat, very good situated in Sodermalm, great neighbourhood. What else?</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a quite nice and quiet room with quite good location which is very near from Metro and only 15 mins walk from old town. Mallika is a very kind and helpful host with a little lovely cat named Ramses</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We never got to actually meet Mallika but her flat was clean and beautiful. She gave very good instructions on how to get to her home from central station. She is located in a nice area of Soldermalm and is close to many shops and cafes. I highly recommend Mallika's home to others.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"I can't say enough good things.  This was my first time using Airbnb, as well as my first time in Stockholm, and I am now an enthusiastic fan of both.  Mallika was the perfect host!  She is kind and thoughtful and knows the city well, so she gives great recommendations.  The restaurant she suggested served possibly the best meal of my life (\"\"The Blue Door</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We really think Mallika's apartment is in one of the very best point of Stockholm. The quarter is really cool, young, calm but also full of beauty small shops and place to eat (bakery, small supermarket). Underground station is just 2 minutes walking. Stockholm, generally speaking, seems always a safe city. \r\n\r\nThe building is really good, the apartment is not big but the guest bedroom is really big (more then it looks like in photos). Interior design is warm modern swedish style (we liked it a lot). It's very clean and everything works well. The bedroom is full of light (and we liked it). For people who need total dark during the night, consider is not simply to totally avoid natural light during the night (in june day light is from 4am to 22pm) also shutting the curtains.\r\n\r\nWe were always out, so we did not live the apartment too much. For people who need privacy or want to stay a lot inside, must consider that to go to the kitchen it's necessary to pass through the living room where Mallika (only night time) sleeps in a curtain separated area.\r\nThis was not a big deal for us. \r\nWi-fi works great.\r\n\r\nWe didn't use kitchen to prepare food but Mallika alway asked if we need it and explain how to use it. \r\nWe always come back late, but no problem about noise for Mallika (of course we were not noisy..). \r\n\r\nThe price is absolutely fair compared to Stockholm standard. In our experience we were surprised that Stockholm is cheaper then London or Paris.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mallika's apartment is in an excellent location. Very easy to get to, with clear instructions from Mallika. We loved that we were very close to some of the best coffee places in Stockholm! The apartment is very clean and the bedroom is spacious. We enjoyed our stay in Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed our stay with Mallika. The apartment is in an EXCELLENT location, in a fantastic neighborhood next to one of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. It is a very nice, short walk into Old Town and the rest of central Stockholm. And the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet at night such that sleeping with the windows open poses no problem. The only issue was that I was woken up when Mallika left the apartment early our first night of sleeping (around 3am) for travel; this made it very hard for me to get a good night's rest the first night, although my wife was able to sleep through it.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a good stay at Malika home. The neighborhood and nice, cozy coffee shops and close to everything you want to see in Stockholm. The room was nice and bright like the picture. The rest of the house is a bit dark. Malika has a really nice cat. In the bed you roll toward each other, so perfect for a romantic stay.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mallika is a perfect host. The apartment is well located, closed to the metro station, restaurants and caffees. It is an excellent starting point to explore Stockholm. If you like cats, you will fall in love with Ramses.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>My mom and I really enjoyed our short wintery stay in Stockholm at Malika's apartment. We didn't get to meet her, but Malika was always ready to answer any questions via email.  \r\nWe absolutely love what she did with the place; it's comfortable, very nicely decorated and homely. Furthermore, set in the vibrant Södermalm district of central Stockholm, the apartment is excellently located. Especially if you are looking for a place close to small, inviting boutiques, which focus on design and vintage, and good value places to eat that the locals themselves would frequent.\r\nWe will highly recommend it to our family & friends, and we are already looking forward to staying here again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The location, with just a few steps away from a underground station, was perfect to explore Stockholm. The whole apartment is cosy and quiet, perfect to chill out after a strenious day of sightseeing. Södermalm is a charming neighbourhood full of bars, cafés and small shops. Mallika was a helpful host and made sure everything was good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful place with large room. Exactly as described. I had a very good time</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika's house is clean, cosy and centrally located. It was perfect for us! We haven't seen Mallika that much, (because she was away during Midsommar weekend ) but the communication was good.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It's a great place.there are many stores and restaurants near by.we like your house because it is really warm and comfortable.Just feel like our home!And there are two cute cats company us.I do have good  memories here!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika's place was great for our stay in Stockholm! My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights and we felt very at home during our stay. The bed is comfy, the room is big and bright, and the cats are adorable! Both cats are super friendly and love attention but listened when they were asked to leave our room. There's a nice tea kettle which came in handy after a day in the cold, and a nice kitchen, although we didn't end up using it. The location was a good spot in Sodermalm, which has a lot of restaurants, bars, clubs and young people. Its very easy to walk around Stockholm, but if necessary the metro stop is a few steps away around the corner.  Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mallika is an excellent host! She answered all our questions about the area and Stockholm and made us feel welcome. The room is exactly like it looks in the picture (with a little kettle and water jug) and is perfectly clean and homely. Her cats are also extremely friendly! \n\nIt is comfortable walking distance from pretty much all of the tourist attractions - especially Gamla Stan and some great bars and restaurants are nearby. The metro is about 2 minutes away from her house. We would love to stay here again if we come back to Stockholm in the future!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Mallika and Raphael are both very nice and provided me with directions and help with taxi's, and I adored their cats - particularly Ramses! The space is as-advertised and the room is comfortable with lovely decor and tea and water in the room. The location is excellent and close to Gamla Stan. \n\nI had some trouble with checking in, as the safe for the key is a bit confusing as it is not a typical digital safe, but a kind neighbour was able to help me unlock it and Mallika followed up soon after. Otherwise all went smoothly :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika is a gracious woman and her house breathe a pleasant atmosphere. Swedisch, artistic and I felt  welcome as a guest. Mallika is a very good host, unfortunately we only met each other fast, because she was on her way to travel. \nThe apartment is located in a nice area of Stockholm. Very easy to get from airport Arlanda by train. I had a very good time!! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We could not have asked for anything more regarding Mallika's apartment! The location is perfect: a short walk to Gamla Stan (10-15 minutes) but still far enough into the low-key and locals-dominated Södermalm that you avoid the tour groups and noise that occupy other parts of the city. Keyless entry into the building makes check in easy, and the apartment had more than enough layers of security to make us feel safe. 2 blocks from the Mariatorget stop, it is also easy to access other parts of the city by metro. (BTW, the bakery around the corner - Bageri Petrus - is amazing and definitely worth the visit... every day). Thanks again, Mallika, for the wonderful stay!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The house was beautiful, Mallika had an amazing check in setup and was able to let me keep some bags at hers after the checkout. Location was brilliant, one block from the metro, two blocks from bus stations with cafes and a coop close by. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika was good with communication, the location was really close to nice cafe's and restaurants (however the cute bakery-cafe is closed until August unfortunately), and the room was big, filled with light, and clean. Her two cats were also very lovely. The kitchen is also beautiful and a nice spot to sit and read. Mallika stayed in a section of the living room during our stay as the apartment is one bedroom.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Loved our stay here! This apartment is amazing and central to shops, cafes and restaurants. Mallika was pleasant to deal with and very accommodating. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Wow! This flat and its location exceeded our expectations! The flat was beautiful, airy, comfortable, quiet and spacious. The location was excellent, with charming restaurants and shops just steps away.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The apartment is very cute, plenty of space with all amenities in a safe, secure building and a lovely courtyard for the summer. It’s in a perfect location with everything near by and easy access to public transport. Very easy to and from Arlanda. Although I never met Mallika, she was excellent with communication and made our stay very easy. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Stockholm. Many thanks Mallika.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mallika has an amazing flat. It's in a prime location in Södermalm. Around the corner from the metro, surrounded by cool coffee shops and restaurants, all while maintaining a quiet neighborhood feel. It's only 2 metro stops from Old Town but also close enough to walk, about 30ish min. The flat is also HUGE. Has everything you would need. I regret we didn't stay longer. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful and unique room in a great hip location. Lots of interesting restaurants nearby. Near T-Bana to go to other city locations. Mallika send us good informations and helped us in whatever we needed.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good place to stay. The interior is pretty nice, everything is ready for your stay. The apartment is not far from Old Town, there are several supermarkets nearby (Willys, ICA)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika is a very nice host.   Check-In & Check-Out works perfect. The appartement is very good located and quiet big. We definitely come back!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mallika's place is amazing! It is very nicely decorated and in a great location next to train and metro stations. She gave us cards to use public transport which helped out a lot. She also has a box of things to do in Stockholm. We enjoyed our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Mallika’s place is amazing and in a perfect location for links to the busier parts of stockholm - her place had a very authentic feel to it and we would definitely recommend to anyone slightly interested !</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika is a very nice Host and responds very fast. \nHer Appartment is really Clean, spaceous and in a very good Location. Perfect Appartment for a Stockholm Trip. It was a pleasure to stay at her space :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very lovely, sweet and cozy place. It was a very nice stay! \nI had an experience living like a local. Nearby a lot of good coffee places, shops and restaurants. Also perfect transport connection. \nHost is sweet and thoughtful, we had an easy communication!\n+ there are two cutest cats\nHighly recommend :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The location is amazing and the room itself is perfect as well. Really cosy and a lot of room.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Mallika is a very gentle and helpful host! We had everything we needed and a very comfortable stay in a neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and cafes. In spite of that in the apartment it’s very quiet and peaceful on the balcony to the inside. We enjoyed it a lot and want to come back ☺️</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at Max's place. Location is good, apartment is fine and everything was easy to arrange with him. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We were very comfortable at Max's apartment.  It is clean, spacious and easily accommodated our party of six.  The location was excellent too.  We walked to Central Stockholm, Gamla Stan, and to the ferry for Djurgarden.  Max was a wonderful host.  He actually sat down with us at his kitchen table and pointed us to some of his favorite restaurants and sites.  He was also easily accessible when we had a question.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Unfortunately, we had difficulty emailing each other on our private email address.  I could receive messages through airbnb.com and told Max that, but he would leave me messages telling me to check my email!  We never met Max.  Our primary needs for two couples were 2bath, bedrooms, and internet.  We paid more for internet, but it was a necessity for business and other private calls.\r\n\r\nEnough to say that it never did work, even tho we just happened to still be in the flat one morning  when a technician arrived so we stayed there while he tried to fix things.  I don't think we should have had to stick around for repairmen!\r\n\r\nThe flat is in a good, tight building and a very quiet neighborhood around the corner from a tram station and only a couple mile walk into town.\r\n\r\nThere were no instructions for using the oven so we did not cook in the flat.   It would have been nice to have some specific restaurant recommendations or local guides in the flat.\r\n\r\nWE loved \"\"Harry's Bar\"\" restaurant around the corner so much we ate there two nights and met Paul</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We were seven family members who arrived for a family reunion. Max was very informative and helpful in getting us oriented in the condo as well as the neighborhood.  He had provided maps, three sets of keys, and answered all our questions. There were toys for the seven year old to play with, and good equipment to cook with. The location is close to public transport, parks, plazas, points of interest, restaurants, bars/pubs/cafes and food stores. \r\nWe searched for a condo that could sleep 7 and had two bathrooms, which this condo provided. The fact that there was no living/dining room on the same floor as the kitchen was the biggest disadvantage. You have to climb up a spiral staircase to get to the living room. Consequently we socialized by some of us sitting around the kitchen table and others on the beds. Overall the condo served us well and will be even better after renovations are completed.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Max is a good host. Very easy to communicate with.\r\nHe has been very accomodating for the check in and the check out.\r\nThe flat is very near the public transports and the zone is peaceful.  It's practical to visit the city from the apartment.\r\nWe had 3 keys for 8 persons, it was perfect.  But just 1 badge to enter in the building during the night.\r\nThe mattress are not all comfortable but for a few nights it was ok.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great experience with Max's place in Stockholm! The apartment is in a fun area with very good access to public transportation. We were a group of 6 adults (3 couples) and the apartment had plenty of room for us. Max provided some helpful tips for the local area to get us started</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice location. Love the romantic atmosphere of old town. Lots of shops, retaurant and good cafe in walking distance. Well connected to other part of the city. The apartment is decorated with lovely furniture. \n\nMax is very good host. Even we did not meet him during the stay, he helped us with many useful information.\n\nRecommended.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A quirky, cosy and homely place in a good location, right next to Stockholm South station.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The accomodation was really fantastic for our 8 people group. We stayed there for few days and enjoyed our city break. Stockholm is very big city but Max`s flat has very good localization. The owner is very polite and helpfully. Thank you very much again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We rented the entire apartment. We were 8 of us and there was plenty of space to spread out. The area is really convenient to visiting Stockholm. The bus, train and tram connections are excellent. The apartment has a lot of restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We didn't get to meet Max, but the communication from him was excellent. Would highly recommend Max's apartment for future travelers</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Max's place is in an incredible location that is at once quiet, but at the same time close to numerous restaurants, the metro, and the train. It is also within in walking distance of many Stockholm attractions. Max was flexible with our arrival time and had provided an amazing amount of information before we got there. We were two couples staying there, and the layout of his apartment afforded both couples privacy.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thanks Max for all your help. We had a great time in Stockholm. It was good being so close to the train and to the supermarket.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Good location. 20 minutes walk from the old town. Lots of good places to eat nearby. Max a kind host but it is his home so he may pop back at times. Relaxed check in and check out. Apartment was great for 2 couples. Lots of space and privacy.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Thank you! Flat was amazing. We were 6 people (3 couples) and there was plenty of space for us all. The kitchen is really well equipped and the entire space is really comfortable. The location is excellent. Walking distance to everywhere (restaurants, bars, shops) plus close to both the train and metro. Highly recommended! Five stars ⭐️ </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Max’s place was amazing!!! Central and just as described! Great for groups!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Beautiful apartment with the perfect location in Gamla Stan in Stockholm, near good restaurants and with good communications to the rest of the city. The apartment is impressive, warm and homey and Pontus made sure we had everything we needed. I can warmly recommend Pontus as host and I hope to be back in the apartment next time in Stockholm. \n\nTack för denna gång!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The location of the flat cannot be better! It is within walking distance to the main highlights in Stockholm and perfect to walk around Gamla Stan. The flat is beautiful, full of light and history, perfectly clean and well equipped. Pontus and Julia were great hosts, they also made excellent recommendations of places to eat nearby, which were fantastic!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Lovely, very comfortable, and stylish apartment. We had an excellent stay!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>we are a family of 4 persons and really enjoyed staying at this apartment. Heath is an excellent host,  really very helpful and took care for us. The communication was immediate and easy check in and out. The apartment is beautiful, very quiet, fully equipped (our children enjoyed the large TV screen) and perfectly located to discover Stockholm. We had a rented car and no problems finding a space to park. Across the street is super market, the area full with nice bars and restaurants.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I communicated with Heath over email with great ease - he left clear instructions fir all the basics and in fact we never met him face-to-face. His place was spacious and perfect for 3 friends traveling. The apartment was well appointed and quiet. It is very near all the hot-spots in Sodermalm and we just strolled a few meters to whatever we needed or desired.\r\n\r\nThis apartment represents extremely good value for money with no hassle whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI can highly recommend this listing!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a wonderful time! Amazing apartment, excellent area and superb help from the owner. Clean. Quiet all was perfect!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I didn't have the chance to meet Heath since he had to catch a train before I arrived, but the communication was excellent, the apartment is really in a great location, the interior courtyard is cozy, and the apartment is just as described. There's nothing like stepping out of the shower unto a heated bathroom floor. He even kindly left my friends and me a bottle of wine. I would certainly recommend this place. Thanks, Heath!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Heath's place was perfect for my stay in Stockholm. A great space, a great location and a great host! He was quick to reply to any questions that I had, and suggested some really good options for places to check out locally. Highly recommend if you're looking for a place to stay in Soder!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Communication was very swift and accurate with Heath, before, during and after our stay at his lovely VERY centrally located apartment. The place was great for us as a small family but I am sure it is also great for people who want to discover the nightlife of Sodermam a bit. And having all types of ketchup (!), pickles and chilli powder to use is great to be able to actually cook some meals.\r\n\r\nAt a stones throw away there is a ICA supermarket that does fresh croissants from 9 in the morning and bigger shops are only down the road too. \r\n\r\nWe brought our children with us, the playgrounds in the neighbourhood are really nice and have someone to actually entertain the kids a bit. A new experience to us.\r\n\r\nOverall a very good experience to stay at Heaths apartment and would def recommend</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Heath was very nice and helpful in everything. From providing all needed thugs for out baby (cradle, high chair...) to guiding us for better transportation.\nThe apartment if great and the location very very good. Close to the public transport and in a nice and trendy area of the city. There if also a great park for kids close to the apartment. \nThe apartment is very nicely furnished and has very thing you need, even Netflix and TIVO, with (real) high speed internet and a large TV.\nHighly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We just loved this place so much! \r\nPerfect location, very well-connected to other parts of the city, nice and extremely cozy flat (what you see in the pictures shown is even better in the reality) with – really – ALL THE THINGS you need.\r\nPär is a very thoughtful host, he was amazingly helpful throughout the whole process and gave us the warmest welcome ever in Stockholm as well as all the informations and advices we needed. He did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable and so it was because it really felt like home! \r\nCheck-in and check-out were simple and communication was always impeccable. \r\nI would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this place to anyone travelling to Stockholm. \r\nTack for having us, Pär! :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>When we arrived in Stockholm, Pär himself was on vacation but he asked his girlfriend Susan to welcome us in the apartment. She was really kind and gave us directions on how to get to the apartment. When we arrived everything was really clean and it was way bigger compared to the pictures! We had two amazing weeks in Stockholm and that was also because the apartment is on an awesome place close to several bus and metro stops. Both Pär and Susan were very friendly when we met them and we would really recommend everyone to rent this apartment when they go to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>all good</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice apartment for up to 4 guests,looks exactly like in description, excellent location close to many buses well related to everything.Par is a  wonderful host and he gave us useful information  about Stockholm ; we had a very pleasant stay and we recommend this accommodation.\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Par was a very gracious host. He met us upon arrival and gave a nice tour of his apartment and an overview of the city. The apartment is located with very good bus access. Everything about our stay was great.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Par was super nice and had everything ready for us upon arrival.  He even had a few bears and some champagne for us.  The apartment was the perfect size for my wife and I plus two kids.  The location is good as you can easily walk to the Metro or along the water to downtown.  We loved the neighborhood with our kids as there was easy grocery shopping nearby, great city parks with kids play areas, and an easy walk to all metro or boat transportation.  Par was super nice and had lots of info about the area to help.  After doing museums and activities for days which tired out the kids, it was nice to have a great neighborhood with parks and even a little beach nearby plus lots of cafes to just relax.  Having a kitchen were we could cook meals for the family really helped make the trip affordable for us. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Par was really nice host. He was helpful and kind. The location of flat was good. It could be better if there was an openable sofa. because it wasn't useful for couples. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment was perfect. Everything you need for a good stay is here and the host is nice </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had an awesome experience staying at Pär's apartment in Stockholm. Pär had excellent communication throughout, provided plenty of useful information regarding our stay in Stockholm and was very welcoming (even had a bottle of champagne waiting for us!). \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was exactly as described and was safe, quiet, clean and comfortable. The location was great for us, about a 15 minute walk from downtown Stockholm, but right next to multiple easy public transport options. The neighborhood was great as well, with plenty of grocery stores, restaurants, etc nearby, plus a lovely stretch of waterfront nearby to relax at. \r\n\r\nLoved staying at Pär's place, would highly recommend and stay there again when in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pär was a very friendly host. I was traveling with 2 other friends and he gave us some very good advice about the city.\r\nThe appartement is located in a very convenient place, 15 minutes from the city center. It is also very clean and well maintained.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Although I didn't have the chance to meet Pär, the communication and welcome to the house was excellent. \n\nThe house is very well equipped and it even looks better than on the pics. Really cozy house close to anywhere in the city with the well connected transportation.\n\nThanks Pär!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartement is very cosy, clean, good located and well equipped! You can reach the city center by foot or by bus. The bus station is just in front of the house. The organisation and communication with Pär was very uncomplicated. He was always accessible for questions. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Pärs bolig was amazing. He waited for us outside his place where he greeted us welcome. He gave us a full tour of the appartment, gave advice on shopping possibilities, where public transportion could be found and so on. Pär was very guestfree and had set a bottle of champagne in the fridge for us and let us use all tea, coffee, ketchup etc. that were om the cabinnets. The appartment was close to the center, public transportation and a beautiful harbor only 1 minute away. The neighboorhood was also very quiet. We would definitely love to come back again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Me and my family had a good time in Pär's apartment. It is comfortable and fully equipped. It is really well located because the bus stopping just at the door carries you to many tourist attractions and the walk from there to the city hall by the lake is really nice. Recommendable!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything was as described and agreed. Par met us personally, gave guidelines for nice stay in Stockholm.\nReally good and calm location, perfect accessibility by public transport, walk-able distance from downtown even for 9/10 years kids, nice playground within 15 minutes walk. Several supermarkets around the place.\nPlace to return in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good location and quiet zone. About 10mins walk to supermarket and other stores.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice apartament in a nice and quite part of stockolm, very close to the center.\nI recommend to everybody. Moreover Par is a good host</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Nice apartment in a quiet area. The bus stop is just 30 mt from the entrance and reaches the city center in 10 minutes. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk to subway and main stores, but a mini market open till midnight is located just in front of the house. The apartment is composed by a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom and 2 bathrooms (blind). A small terrace gives a view on the street and nearby lake (100 mt).\nThere is enough space for a family of 4 people, note that the children shall sleep on the couch. The apartment is a real one, so you will find all kind of sauces in the fridge, herbs & dressings. Large screen tv with hundreds of channels, excellent wi-fi.\nPär gave us helpful tips for the public transportation and left the brochures for almost all Stockholm main attractions.\nRecommended.\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Location: This is an apartment located about a 20min walk from the central train station. Nearby are supermarkets (a corner store is across the street, too), drugstore, liquor store and restaurants. Although Stockholm can be difficult to see on foot sometimes because of the water barriers we found most places to be within an hour of the apartment and if you're crazy like us you can even walk to Drottningholm Palace to get a sense of the suburbs and take the boat back.\n\nCommunication: Upon our arrival in the city, Pär responded quickly on the AirBnB app and was there when we got to the apartment. \n\nThe Residence: If you are an school AirBnB person like us who prefers staying at places that are actually lived in rather than just rented out as income, this a good choice, with his extensive book collection showing his love for travel and mystery novels. He made space for us in his fridge and utensils were available for cooking if we wanted. \n\nOverall: We were very happy with our stay and would definitely come again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Apartment: this was our first time staying in an Airbnb that is used as a primary residence. It was like staying in your uncle's bachelor pad. Not a beautiful place to relax and spend time, but a good place to come back to sleep that is safe, comfortable and spacious. A big bedroom and two bathrooms were a plus. It was clean and the pictures were accurate. \n\nLocation: it's not walkable from anywhere unless you really love to walk a lot. Bus was about 10 minutes from the central station, other sites were 20-30+ minutes by bus and tram. This is a residential area and there isn't a lot close by, so this is a quieter neighborhood away from the tourists.\n\nCommunication was very easy, and we were pleased with our stay overall.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Pär’s apartment is great. Comfortable, centrally located and big. Pär is also an excellent host, available all the time. Definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We loved the apartment. The photos did not do it justice, as it was cosy and homely with lots of personal touches, and is lived in by the owner occasionally. So, the books, photos and things in the kitchen added real character. It was also very quiet on the fourth floor, and just off the main road, so quieter.\n\nPar was very hospitable, and checked us in with a warm welcome, with plenty of tips and left us sparkling wine. He also let us leave luggage for the day at the end of the stay, and was very easy to communicate with before the stay. This was only my third Air B and B, and the best yet.\n\nThe apartment is very handy (30 seconds walk) to bus routes 3 to the Old Town, 50 and 54 (to Kungstradgarden, where you catch no 7 tram to the Djurgarden attractions) so was excellent for public transport. 10 minutes walk to the City Hall, and 3 minutes to the waterside Malarpaviljorgen floating bar/restauarant). Metro 5 minutes away. Convenience store opposite, or ICA supermarket and several restaurants (we liked French Bergamott) with 5 minutes down a small hill). So, ideally situated, in a local but safe neighbourhood. \n\nThanks Par.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pär is a super host for a very good reason. Not only was the apartment great and exactly as represented in the listing but also he was very helpful on the check-in.  There are a couple of things that aren’t covered in the listing and the reviews which might be good to know. First off, there are some stairs because the apartment is on a “half floor.” Despite the fact that we both use canes, this was not a serious problem especially since Pär helped us in with the luggage. The other thing that was not in the listing was that the building has laundry facilities in the basement. Pär  thoughtfully booked us a time so that we could continue our journey with clean clothes!\n\nWe would totally recommend this booking for anyone wanting a nice quiet place to stay in Stockholm with good access to transportation to get just about anywhere you want in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was a great place to stay in Stockholm! Check in and communication with Par was easy, the apartment was super spacious, we loved the balcony, and the water and good eats were only a block away. So convenient. Would definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>the location of the apartment is very good, a short walk to the radhuset, with bus stops close to the apartment,it is bigger than we expected and comfortable.we can recommend this stay ;)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good stay in Par’s apartment.\nThis is a very nice apartment, well located to visit Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Pär's place was excellent and very well priced! I suited us perfectly as we love to cook a lot while away and the kitchen was very well equipped. It was close to a bus and metro station but also the main sights were still walk able. He let us check in as soon as we arrived in Stockholm and when we had a late flight the last day - let us leave our bags at his place. All in all a very pleasant stay - thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Thank you so much for your warm welcome! Pär is an amazing host he prepared everything for us (map of the city, fresh water, bottle of Champagne etc...) the apt was very clean and bigger than we thought! It is also well located :) We did not take the subway but we walked to the city center (20m). I definitely recommend this apt for your stay in Stockholm! Thanks again :)</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Pärs appartment is super cozy and perfectly located for discovering Stockholm. Very good and easy communication with Pär and nice welcome drink. I would definitely come back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great apartment - good location and area of Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is well-equipped and has a good interior style.

I recommend these apartments.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My friends and me had a really good time at Gabriella's place and in Stockholm. The apartment was new and very spacious, also for 4 persons and it was perfectly cleaned and prepared when we arrived. Everything you need (supermarket, bars, restaurants, underground) is very close to the apartment and the city center is just a few minutes away by tube. Gabriella offered her help and assistance at any time and was very flexible with arriving and departure times. I highly recommend this nice place and also Grabriella as a host. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gabriella was very friendly when we checked in and her flat is beautiful! The location was excellent for us as well, easy to get around from, but not in the most touristy area. Gabriella gave us some great recommendations on restaurants and activities, which made our stay even better. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My family (husband and two young daughters) had a fantastic stay at Gabriella's beautiful and spacious flat.  The pictures do not do this amazing apartment justice--it is very large and modern with every comfort of home including an induction cooktop, dishwasher, washing machine, and heated tile floors in the bathroom.  The apartment is conveniently located near great restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping, and just steps away from the subway and buses that will take you to anywhere in Stockholm.  Gabriella thoughtfully filled her fridge with breakfast essentials knowing that my jetlagged children would likely wake up hungry in the middle of the night.  She also left toys for my children to play with.  We could not be more pleased with the entire experience.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gabriella is a very friendly and accommodating host! The flat is light and spacious, very comfortable and just perfect for a family. Bus and metro only about 100 meters away with very good connections anywhere in the city, it is easy to get around. There are also surprisingly good restaurants within a couple minutes of walk. Gabriella gave us generous tips about sights, activities and other practicalities. Simply outstanding experience! Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gabriella is a caring, interested and reliable host.

We were four adults and two small children, and very much enjoyed the space, the balcony, good beds, and the well functioning and up-to-date (not to mention beautiful) kitchen. The flat is peaceful and quiet, located on a calm street. The apartment is very central with all the main attractions of Stockholm walking distance away. Gabriela is a wonderful host, flexible and easy to communicate with - thank you so much for having us! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment ist wonderful.

Gabriella is a very nice person, we rented her apartment for 3 days, and it was a pleasure to live in it. This flat is realy close to the metro station, the district is very peaceful and nice. The neighbours are extremely quite, and i am not sure, they are enen exist. Inside of the apartment everything is perfect too. It is very cosy, furniture is good and comfortable, you get all the stuff that you need in the kitchen, beds are very good too, and bathroom doesn`t have any problems. \r\nIn other words, if you are going to Stockholm, don`t miss that apartment.\r\nAnd a big thanks to Gabriella for her hospitality.\r\nGood luck everyone!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very nice host,lovely place and good location.Everything is just like the photo.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gabriella was an excellent host!

She responded quickly to our emails and was there to greet us and give us great tips about seeing the city and transport. The flat was very cosy and comfortable and beautifully furnished. It was close to public transport, restaurants (great pizzas just across the road) and supermarkets. We really enjoyed our stay here and would certainly recommend this flat when staying in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed at this place for the second time. The previous visit happened last summer and we were then so satisfied we decided to come back again. And everything was just as good as it was the last time! The flat is very functional, perfect for a family and the location is simply excellent. Public transport from this place is easy to any location in Stockholm. Gabriella accommodated our wishes very well and gave new travel tips, for example restaurant recommendations that turned out to be really good. We recommend Gabriellas flat to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gabriella offers it all: A clean, beautyful and stylish flat with a good location, quick communication and good tipps what to do and where to eat.

Nice, quiet place good for resting and for my group (working/conference). It was easy to hook our phones and lap tops up to sound system to play our music. Location very close to the train and easy walk to walk to central station, waterfront, and shopping. Area around apt. also has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants, bars, night life & cafes. Peter went out of his way to make our group feel welcome, including picking me up at the train and even leaving food & drinks for us. When one of us left something in the apt. he let us know immediately so we can go get it. Excellent stay! </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>A great apartment that comfortably accomdated 6 people. Clean, spacious and close to some nice restaurant. \nWould definitely stay again and would highly recommend if you're visiting Stockholm. \nPeter is an excellent host.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Peter a été un excellent hôte. Son appartement est très beau, chaleureux, facile d'accès  et idéalement placé près d'une station de métro ou de lignes de bus . Peter nous a réservé un excellent accueil et a su nous donner les bonnes adresses utiles du quartier ( commerces et restaurant). Nous avons passé un très bon moment chez lui. Le seul petit point négatif que nous aimerions signaler , est la moins bonne qualité du 3ème couchage en canapé lit par rapport aux deux autres lits qui sont des plus confortables. Les nuits ont été plus difficiles pour les amis qui y ont dormi. \nNous recommandons malgré tout cette très bonne adresse.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ann Sofie was just an amazing and excellent host. Even though we didn't see her we got in contact all the time and she helped us with the best info and the best tips of town: 100% recommended. The flat is awesome and comfortable; very well located in a beautiful neighbourhood. We spent a very good time there; I would come back again to her apartment without thinking twice!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Wonderful, comfortable loft space.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay. The owner was friendly and very communicative and provided an excellent set of instructions for the flat and a nice personal guide for the neighborhood and all of Stockholm. The flat is in a great location and all points are easily accessible. It is well furnished, with a great kitchen area and a lovely terrace for enjoying the late setting sun. All in all, I would rate this experience very highly and would return again if it was available. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Ann-Sofie has a great flat in Stockholm. It is very clean and we appointed and situated very conveniently with good access via Odenplan. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Everything about Ann-Sofie’s apartment is just perfect and we really enjoyed our 5 night stay there.  It is spacious, beautifully furnished, superbly equipped and has many quirky features that make it feel very unique and special. The apartment is every bit as good as the photos would indicate and was spotlessly clean.\r\n The weather was hot at the time of our visit but the numerous windows and door to the balcony make it feel airy and also very light. (The bedroom’s blackout blinds were ideal for the light nights!)\r\nThe location is quiet and very convenient for the Odenplan metro station and therefore easy and quick to get to locations all over Stockholm.\r\nWe did not meet Ann-Sofie but her communications and instructions were prompt, helpful and clear; so consequently there was no problem with anything.\r\nWe would unreservedly and highly recommend this apartment; why would you consider a hotel when you could stay somewhere as lovely as this?\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We had a brilliant holiday based at Fredrik's comfortable and stylish home. The location is excellent and it was very easy to get into the centre of Stockholm by bus. We loved being able to walk to a great place for swimming. We would love to return!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Stylish house in a quiet neighbourhood. Public transport links were good. We found the house well equipped with everything we needed.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was a fantastic Airbnb stay. No problems whatsoever.\r\n\r\nLocation: very central in Stockholm. There's tons of great restaurants around.\r\n\r\nInterior: nicely and very functionally decorated.\r\n\r\nCommunication, etc.: Very good. Gustav waited for me at the apartment, we had a nice chat (he recommended me a terrific Swedish restaurant), and then left me to enjoy the apartment. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Apartment was really great.  It was a good space, in a lovely location, with all the facilities I needed.  Really good - and recommended. \r\n10.02.16</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, nice, comfortable apartment. Like others have said, the 4 flights of stairs can be daunting after a day of sites and drinks, but it's good exercise! Close to groceries, transportation, restaurants n bars</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gustav's place was really good - great location, as described on the listing/photos and Gustav was a fantastic host. Would recommend this place to everyone! Thanks Gustav. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I really liked the spacious apartment with its high ceilings, good wifi and even relaxing Netflix availability, right in the downtown in Stockholm. Gustav was a great and informative host. Looking forward to staying there again!\r\nBreakfast recommended at Caffe Nero, just 400m away from the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Gustav's place was absolutely amazing.  It's simple and beautiful.  It has tall ceilings, calming layout and is located in a great part of town.  And Gustav couldn't be a cooler or nicer guy - it was the best Airbnb I've stayed in. \n </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is in a great location, and it is very good inside! Gustav us a very kind and comunicative person!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Gustav's place was amazing! The apartment is very tastefully decorated, clean, and feels very open and spacious.  The location is central, right near a metro stop, and it's about a 10 minute metro ride, or 15 to 20 minute walk from the central train station.  There are many cute restaurants and cafes right near the apartment.  And it's very easy to get to all the major Stockholm attractions.\n\nGustav is an excellent host.  He was in touch before our arrival and greeted us right when we got to the apartment.  He gave us great recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to try.  He also offered us the use of his and his girlfriend's bikes in case we wanted a quicker way to get around the city.  We ended up walking all over the place because we prefer to see the city that way, but it was very nice of Gustav to offer and good to know that the option was there.  Check in and check out were a breeze, and we enjoyed our stay there tremendously.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Gustav's place is great. The apartment is located very close to the T-banna (Stockholm subway) and central enough to reach anywhere is Stockholm in a short amount of time. Gustav is an excellent communicator and a great host. Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Gustav is one amazing host.. I would love to thank him for his hospitality! It was a great place... It was soothing and provided me a lot of much needed peace of mind I needed from my recent Official trips.\nPost work, it was great to look forward to returning home for the comfort and peace it provided.\nThe place is lovely and nothing else could've made my official trip so relaxing and soothing!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is located in a great neighbourhood. Shops and bars are near. Transportation is around the corner as well. The bathroom is better than on the pictures. Bed was comfy. Stairs to the apartment can be a bit intimidating, but a good exercise.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Gustav is very accommodating and good st communicating. The apartment is well located. There is no lift so a four storey climb.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Moa was an excellent host - the communication was swift, precise and welcoming. And she had put out little notes for us as guides to the flat - and had bought us milk, bread and other small stuff, that made us feel at home.\r\nThe flat was very practical for us: a family of five. Very neat and clean. Charming with a balcony where we could eat our meals out. \r\nThe area is a southwestern suburb to Stockholm, but the tubestation is just around the corner - and trains are precise and often. It is a quiet neighbourhood - green and with good grocery shopping, cafées and good ethnique take-aways. People are nice and friendly. It didnt take long before our 10 year old son had found a boy in the area that played football and  played with him and his friends at the local school several times.\r\nThanks Moa - for a wonderful stay. We will be asking to borrow your flat again next time we are going to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Yet another excellent Air BnB pick! Moa was the perfect host. She provided us with clear and concise instructions using public transit to arrive at her apartment where she greeted us warmly. She explained how everything worked and said we could contact her with any questions we might have had. She even left us some breakfast stuff in the fridge! The apartment was as the photos suggested. It was a lovely lived-in, sun-filled, bright, clean, tidy and spacious for two couples, which we were. Above all, although it was located outside the city centre, the metro stop was a two to three-minute walk from the apartment. The journey into and out of the city centre was 15 minutes. Hardly anything at all.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Apartment was a excellent choice for  family of four stay in Stockholm.  Convenient location to the subway into town about 15 minutes.  Also street parking was available even at late evening hours.\r\nOur host Moa was very accommodating. Our flight was delayed and we arrived late in the evening. Moa was happily waiting for us and gave us a quick lay of the land and a few tips before leaving us for the night. She was also so kind to have a couple of items stocked in the kitchen (even a little Swedish chocolate!!! This was a first for us and we are frequent airbnb/ (Hidden by Airbnb) users) for the tired travelers that we were.  It was great to not have to search for breakfast(especially) on our first morning. Thanks Moa!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We were four friends ans we stayed three nights. It is a very nice flat to stay for the short, for friends and family.

It is comfortable, spacious, bright, warm and equipped with all necessary. Ideal for a company of 5 persons.The place is close to the metro station. The area around the apartment is quiet, peaceful and nice. Grocery store and cafes are close to the apartment.  Moa is hospitable and easy to communicate. We didn't have the pleasure to meet her,but she gave us some help with directions and tips on the city, also left us some coffee/tea and chocolate.\r\nThanks Moa for a wonderful stay. We would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone, and hope we'll be back!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is really a great apartment for 6 of us. We have two nice days in stockholm with such a good place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"First, the location is great and the people staying at the hostel were very nice.  However, I did not feel good about the experience.  First, the apartment pictured in the ad is not the apartment we received.   Second, the ad said it is a two bedroom apartment.  It was a one bedroom with four bunkbeds.  Third, the clothes washer pictured is not in your apartment.  It is in the basement of the building and accessible to everyone else staying in the building.  This means you can hang out in the basement and guard your clothes or you can skip using the laundry.   Fourth, the \"\"private sauna\"\" described and pictured in the ad is not in your apartment.  It is also in the basement of the building and</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Before our arrival the hostel was very flexible and answered all of my questions. The apartment is a nice size. It can be a little noisier since it's part of a hostel, but when you keep the window closed, it won't bother you. The atmosphere of the hostel is really nice, and the breakfast you can buy was great. Location is amazing, within 5-10 minutes (walking) you're in the busiest shoppingstreets of Stockholm. Lastly, as the other reviews said, the sauna and laundry room aren't part of the apartment, but don't let that deter you from renting this space. Me and my colleagues loved our stay here. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>good location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The place is located in a very central area in Stockholm which makes it super easy to access pretty much anything you want to do in Stockholm.

Maritha is a perfect host who make sure your have a good stay while also giving you all the privacy and room you could imagine. The house is located near the Metro. The breakfast was perfect. Thank you so much for the great days.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>During my 5 day stay in Stockholm, Maritha's apartment provided everything you need when coming home from a day of sightseeing. The bed in the private room is very comfortable! The living room and the kitchen are furnished following cosines (Swedish: mysigt) and simplicity. The whole apartment is really light and exudes a positive atmosphere. It is located near the Fridhemsplan metro- and bus station, which easily connects to the city center. I met Maritha shortly, I would say she is warm and welcoming and has the open mind that enables a good Airbnb experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Maritha accepteted us on a very short notice and has been really helpful.

We stayed at her place over the Easter weekend. Unfortunately we did not had the chance to meet Maritha because she was staying with her family during our visit. Everything went perfectly good: check-in, check-out and if we had a question, she replied within minutes. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighbourhood but still very close to the public transport (around 5-10 mins walk to the next subway/bus station) and all the different areas in town are approachable within 20 minutes. I went to the rooftop once to see the sunset and I think it's really great to chill up there in summer, unfortunately it was very cold when we have been in Stockholm. We would definitely stay again in her apartment the next time we'll be in Stockholm and recommend her place to 100% to other traveller. Thank you very much for your hospitality and trust. Take care and best wishes from Switzerland, Juliana </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\n\n\n\nMaritha is very nice. Its apartment is quiet and pleasant and close to the center and transport. Very good address.\n</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had a great stay at Maritha's place, the room just like in the pictures and the surrounding area is very cozy, great for a walk and there is even a beach close by where you can sunbathe. Also, Maritha is an amazing host , she gave us valuable information regarding the airport bus (arlanda airport) which stops 10min away from her apartment and is much cheaper than the train. She even printed our boarding passes :) Thank you so much for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our room in Maritha 's home was clean and comfortable. The property was within a short distance of a metro stop which allowed easy access to attractions. It was also close to a stop on the airport bus. Maritha 's communication with us was, at all times, excellent.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Maritha's flat is really nice, and the bedroom very comfortable. She made our stay very easy and enjoyable. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to meet, but the communication was really good and we did not have any trouble with anything at all. The area is nice and so easy to get to! If you are looking for a cosy place to stay in Stockholm, don't hesitate to contact Maritha!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Maritha is a lovely, friendly lady.  Her room is nice and quiet, good for two guests, and the bed is very comfortable . To be able to have breakfast with an airbnb is an absolute bonus.  I recommend this place to anyone visiting the city. Bus and underground options are just a few minutes walk away through the quiet neighborhood. I would return for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a very nice private room in a cozy flat with shared bathroom. You can reach the center by foot. Unfortunately, we couldn’t meet Maritha personally, but the communication via e-mail with was fast and good. We really recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Maritha's flat is clean & stylish.  We were greeted by her & Molly her cute dog.  The Flat is located a pleasant 15 mins walk from the central station & 5 mins from the metro if you don't like walking.  Maritha was a good host & offered us a breakfast of yogurt, granola & toast with some nice coffee each day.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>If you want a cosy appartment and a fantastic host, you should stay at marita's place: very clean place, good communication and her tips&tricks are a great plus!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Marita’s house in a good location, we would recommend buying the travel pass to get around. It’s close to the water and a number of public transport options. The breakfast provided was super convenient and appreciated. Marita’s dog, molly, was very cute and we enjoyed playing with her.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Overall stay was good! Clean and cozy apartment although check in was confusing. Marita provided breakfast food which was nice to not have to worry about!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Marita's room and appartment were very welcoming (and decorated with taste). The flat and the neighbourhood are well deserved by both bus and metro, thus the old town and the rest of the city are very accessible.\nThe check-in was really easy and Marita was very reactive by message to give us further informations. She left every morning enough to make a good breakfast in the kitchen.\nWe really enjoyed our stay in Stockholm !\nLast thing, Marita is a very kind and helpful host !\n\nThank you very much !</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Marita was an excellent host. Very polite and helpful. The apartment was stylish and really clean. The view from the bedroom room is amazing. I would definitely recommend it any time!! It is really close to the city center. I loved the place and for sure I’ll try to book it again next time I’m visiting Stockholm. Vi hade en trevlig semester!! Det var jätte roligt!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Stockholm is a lovely city, the more when you can use the airB&b from Lotta Westberg.\r\nThis airb&b is situated in the best part of the town, ostermalm. You get offered a spacy place where you can easily be at yourself organised with very good facilities.\r\nIt is definitely a place where you find hospitality and a warm welcome.\r\nGo there and enjoy! - Stef</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice location.

And the host is very friendly and gives good advice for hot spots. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lotta is very kind, shared a lot of information about Stockholm to me! The location is super good, which is very convenient to get use of train bus, and other public transportation!\nAnd the room is super clean and cozy! It’s a good experience to stay there for 5 days!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"I never actually met Pernilla, but our communication was excellent prior to my stay. I arrived and received the keys with no issues whatsoever. The location of the apartment is perfect, literally right outside of a subway station and with major bus routes 1 or 2 minutes away. This area of Kungsholmen became my favorite part of Stockholm, in the city but with a more neighborhood feel.\r\n\r\nAs for the apartment itself...absolutely perfect. It's a studio, so it's small of course, but there was an amazing \"\"a place for everything and everything in its place\"\" vibe. I stayed for 4 weeks but never had to contact Pernilla as everything I possibly could have needed was there</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I stayed in Pernilla's apartment for one month, while in Stockholm for work. Prior to arrival, Pernilla was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. My arrival date was a few days before she was scheduled to leave but she accommodated my stay anyway so I could come straight to the apartment from the airport, which was very helpful so I did not have to find a second place for those few days. \r\nUpon arrival she showed me around the apartment and the building, suggested some highlights of the neighborhood, and let me know she had left some breakfast food and tea in the kitchen to get me started. However, even if she had not been there to show me around, there were detailed written instructions left on the counter.\r\nThe apartment itself was perfect for me. It is ideal for one person with everything needed for a long stay like mine. The kitchen is equipped with dishes, pots/pans, utensils, etc. and has a dishwasher but no microwave, so food must be heated in the oven. Everything worked properly and was easy to use.  The apartment is setup in a functional way so that, even if it appears small at first, all the spaces are utilized well giving the sense of a larger apartment. Also, there was space cleared in the closet and bathroom so I could store my things.\r\nThe building has an elevator, however, the apartment is on the top floor and the elevator arrives one floor below with stairs that lead to the apartment one flight up. This was not a problem for me, but maybe good to know if you have a lot of luggage or trouble with stairs. I also did not have problems scheduling and using the laundry room which is in another building. \r\nThe location was also perfect. It is directly across the street from a metro entrance, only one stop from Stockholm Central Station where it is possible to transfer to any other train line. There is also a full grocery store on the same block that is open late and very convenient. Although there are shops, restaurants, banks, etc. nearby, the apartment is not too far from the waterfront where there is a trail for walking along the water (and Stockholm is beautiful any time of year). </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lotta's home is fantastically located in a residential area if you want a quiet base close to all the visit-worthy sites in Stockholm (museums, parks/gardens, shopping, really good restaurants) . It takes not more than 5mins walk to Saluhall for breakfast/lunch, 10mins leisurely walk to Djurgardens and 6-7mins leisurely walk to boats/ferries to explore the other islands. Other forms of public transportation are all within 4-5mins of a pleasant walk amongst mostly residential buildings. \r\nLotta herself is a lovely lady who was barely around, but a pleasure to talk to when our schedules crossed. Helpful, welcoming and easy-going were my impressions.\r\nThe flat itself was warm, clean and cozy- exactly what one is looking for a city exploration trip. I would truly recommend it to anyone. I really had a fantastic time in Stockholm- mostly because of Lotta's flat.  </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>A pretty room in a beautiful appartment, located in a quiet upper class district of Stockholm. Some essential rules about noise and privacy to respect, which seems logical to anyone who share one's home. The adress is at few minutes from metro, shops and 20mn by walk from the main sites of the city (Gamla Stan, Soder', Central Station, Djurgarden...) And as you want to be as healthy as swedish people, you walk!\r\nLotta has been adorable, very helpful, and answering any of my questions, giving essential advices and good adresses when I came.\r\nA really nice stay for me, who was working and visiting. Thanks for everything.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lotta's flat & offered room are great! Perfect location in the heart of Stockholm city. Everything from room to kitchen is nice and clean. Lotta offered great hospitality to feel welcome in this amazing city.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lotta is a wonderful host who gave me toooons of good info about places to visit, how to get around with public transit, places to eat, and everything inbetween.\r\n\r\nThe room is very nice as well, having your own key and being able to come and go gave me the flexibility to see the city and take breaks as need be. The shared shower was handled very well (Lotta gives a small plastic container for your shower stuff, so the shower is not crowded and you don't forget anything). Towels were provided as well!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great room (clean, pleasant, well-lit, quiet) in a very nice flat. Wonderful vintage lift with cage doors! Nice location, close to centre, with bars and restaurants nearby. Lotta is an excellent and welcoming host who keeps to herself but makes the stay very pleasant. Just be sure you're okay with the rules: no check-in after 10 pm, no showers after 10 pm (for noise reasons). If you're happy with those rules, it's an excellent choice, highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lotta has a wonderful apartment in an amazing part of Stockholm. Her instructions of how to get to/in her building didn't get to me the first time around so I had some troubles finding her initially. Her apartment is very clean, quiet and comfortable. If you want a quiet stay with little interaction from your host then you should book here. If you want a bit more going on, then maybe look into something else. I do wish she allowed me use of her kitchen (even just to store perishables and not cook) or laundry (ONE laundromat in all of Stockholm).   </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lotta made me feel very welcome, we had good contact beforehand about my time of arrival which was nice. I came for work but Lotta gave supplied a lot of flyers and booklets about Stockholm which were very fun to read during the evenings. Also, she drew interesting places for me to visit on a map. Then there were even clan towels on the bed. The bed was very comfortable and from the room you have  a great view of the street. The apartment is located in a beautiful building and is decorated nicely and makes you feel at home.  In the neighbourhood there is a 7eleven and a coop for groceries. It's very close to the waterside wehere the Grand Hotel is, and about 10 minutes walk to either City/ Castle / Skepsholmen.  Although I came for work, I had a very pleasant stay that felt like a holiday. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lotta is an amazing host! She gave me advice where to go and what to see, that was very useful. Her place has a very central location, easy to walk around the center. The place was clean and nice, totally met my expectations. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lotta is efficient and will answer any questions you may have with detail and care. \n\nThis is a shared apartment with the host. I stayed in a private room, with my own toilet/sink. Bath/shower is shared with host.\nIt's on the 5th floor in a quiet residential street. It's a lovely part of Stockholm, with a few cafes around. \n\nBathroom and bedroom are clean and good condition.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I went to Stockholm for a conference and couldn't be happier with the accomodation. Lotta's place was super nice and convenient: perfect location, very clean and cozy. A good  and relaxing place to come home to after a long conference day! I have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend staying here. Thank you, Lotta!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Electra is super chill,  very personable and has a sweet flat.\r\nEverything you need is here including super fast fibre internet. Which is a god send for me. \r\n\r\nI'm business, so need certain amenities more than a tourist, and hotels have a habit of having super slow web, so it make a nice change to be able to watch some Netflix. Being able to clean my clothes (Washer and Dryer here), cook for myself and have a fridge is also a nice change.\r\n\r\nThe flat is also mega clean, the bed is nice and comfy (definite must), and she has an airbed, or pull out mattress for extra people.\r\n\r\nAnd if you have any questions, Electra is willing to help out. \r\n\r\nOh and the location is smack bang in the middle of it all. Been enjoying the short walk home from the local nightlife. And the T-Bana underground line is less than 5 minutes walk away, at which point all of Stockholm is at your fingertips.\r\n\r\nAnd if you should miss the last tram home, well, you're never to far from Electra's flat it seems.\r\n\r\nSo I can't really say much more positive, I think I've covered it all, Electra and her flat are awesome, and how all on Airbnb should be. And good price too. (Search up the hotels in this area and you'll know what I mean)\r\n\r\n:)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great flat, great host! We had an amazing stay in Electra's flat. \r\nThere is no better location than this to explore Stockholm. \r\nElectra gave us some great recommendations for parties and clubs in the evenings and was overall super chilled and helpful. \r\nCouldn't recommend more :)</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Electra's appartment was the perfect fit for a couple on a city discovering tour. It was nice, cozy, clean and sober. The location was amazing. In the citycenter and close to everything (shopping, restaurants, metro and train station) but non the less perfectly quiet. \r\n\r\nElectra was a very kind and helping host.\r\n\r\nWe were very happy to stay there for a week and would highly recommand this place to anyone who wants to discover the beautiful city of Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>the apartment is exactly as described: very clean and superbly located. electra was a very good and responsive hostess.\nwe enjoyed our stay in stockholm very much.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was my second Airbnb experience in Stockholm and Electra's flat definitely tops the list. \n\nHer place is very spacious and covers all your travelling necessities without feeling too convoluted or overly furnished which helps a great deal in making the flat feel like your home in a very short time. It was super clean and has a very spacious bathroom too. Electra herself was very accommodating and carefully explained everything which I really appreciated. Last but not least, the flat is conveniently situated literally in the heart of the city. It truly doesn't get any better than that. Irrespective of if you want to do some shopping, discover good restaurants and cafés, go for a walk at Djurgården, visit the museeums or make a boat trip, you find everything at a stone's throw distance.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It is a spacious studio, centrally located and quiet at the same time.  Minutes away from the downtown  and the river/bridges/major tourist sites/bus stops/train stations. The place was clean, tidy and with laundry units, feels relaxed like at home.  The host is very accommodating and responded timely and efficiently; has good recommendations around the neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Freja's place is a really great, centrally located place in Stockholm. It's super central; but on a nice quiet street. Best of both worlds of easy access to everything, but being able to get rest when you need it.\n\nThe apt is nice and sunny, while the building is new and in good shape. There are a million great coffee shops nearby, and the subway stops are super close too.\n\nFreja, herself, is very knowledgeable about the city, and a great communicator. In short, I highly recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Freja’s place is perfect from every point of view. Location is very central and the building is amazingly quiet, but once out on the street everything Stockholm can offer as nightlife, restaurants, clubs and bars is there. The flat is perfect for 2\nPeople,  provided with everything you need, bright light-wise and stylish furniture-wise. Easy communication with Freja and flexible check-in and out.</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000 rows.</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":[" %sql\n Select regexp_extract(comments, \"(bad|worse|wrong)\", 1), comments\n from reviews_fixed where regexp_extract(comments, \"(bad|worse|wrong)\", 1) != \"\""],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"372e9321-09cb-4669-b3cd-89cb51dc50f2"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"overflow":false,"datasetInfos":[],"data":[["bad","Li is een hartstikke aardige vrouw die er alles aan doet om je verblijf bij haar zo prettig mogelijk te maken.

It is quite large and spacious however it is not a three bedroom apartment. There is one functioning bedroom that has a closet. The other small room does not have a closet or dresser and there is no place to put your clothes. The third Bedroom is the library which does not have a bed or closet space for clothing. \nMy husband and I and a family friend were in Sweden for our daughters wedding. We were all very respectful and cautious with the apartment. So we were stunned to come home to a scathing email accusing us of miscellaneous damages! The owner claimed that we had damaged the window sills by opening the windows but they were certainly damaged and old when we arrived.  There was a horrific heatwave so of course we needed to open windows\nShe suggested that someone had vomited on her carpet which left us completely speechless! She accused us of breaking a piece of coral in her window sill which we never touched. There are all kinds of knickknacks all over the place and some are in very bad condition.\nI would suggest that you do not rent this apartment if you have any intention of using the kitchen. The owner has just installed a marble countertop that is extremely susceptible to damage. We were very cautious using the kitchen but we’re still accused of damaging the countertop.\nAlso do not invite some of your adult relatives over for dinner as you’ll be accused of being a partier!

You can’t sleep due to loud sounds of the water system (I don’t know exactly what it was). We would never rent the «sharing» apartment in a basement or a cellar (even if I am a big fan of Harry Potter). The bathroom (the bath cabin) is moldy too, and it is need to be replace due to its old conditions. There was no soap neither in the kitchen nor in the bathroom (so we pour the shower gel).

The kitchen is a great common space to sit and mingle.  Where things started going wrong is when we discovered bed bug bites.  It was only after 2 nights and 30+ bites that we wrote to Peter about the issue.  He was completely open and honest, divulging that our room had bed bug issues in the recent past.  He said the room was treated, though we have a hard time believing that.  We were also displeased with the way in which he handled the situation, especially for an AirBnB business owner.  We are saddened to have to divulge this publicly but feel the need to share with others.  Once we presented the problem to Peter, we felt no pro-active manner to 'fix' the problem.  He offered to change the sheets at 11pm before bed time.  Anyone who knows anything about bed bugs, knows that changing the sheets will do nothing at all.  Especially when you have 10 hungry bugs lying across the baseboard behind the bed.  The fear of sleeping in that room another night was tainted with the thought of being covered by multiple bugs in our sleep.  Peter needs to take ownership as a businessman before continuing to offer his services to other travellers.  We know that 5* hotels can be plagued by this, so the actual issue is not the bed bugs - rather the way the situation was handled.  We had to ask to be refunded for the last night's stay and had to fight with AirBnB to get our money back.

The decor is pleasingly minimalist. Elisabet kindly allowed us to check in late, due to our 11 PM arrival (thank you!). Although we didn’t meet Elisabet because of the automatic check in and check out, we really appreciated the responsiveness and streamlined clarity of her Airbnb messaging— both before and during our stay. Her instructions, like the decor, were smartly minimalist and efficient. She trusted our ability to figure out how things work rather than needlessly spelling them out. The amenities were great. The combination washer/dryer was very welcome (we were even able to find an English manual for it online, so using it was no problem). The deck was probably the highlight for us. It faces onto an internal courtyard, basically an enclosed square formed by the backs of multiple apartment buildings and containing bike racks and other useful elements. We felt like residents sitting on the deck eating, drinking, observing, and unwinding. The retractable awning (which blocks both sun and rain) expanded the times of day when we could enjoy the deck. As for the neighborhood, Sodermalm is one of the hippest areas in Stockholm and is conveniently located (with easy access to other areas of the city). Despite the flight of many Stockholm residents to the countryside for the entire month of July, the vibe was still plenty animated for us. The apartment itself, by contrast, was very quiet. Even with the windows open for the cross breeze, the surroundings were generally pretty chill sound-wise. Note that, although the kitchen windows and deck face the internal courtyard, the windows on the opposite side of the apartment (in the living room and bedroom) give a wonderful view of a church steeple and include a playground and other interesting urban areas. Other standouts: the elevator was quite convenient— we were able to fit two people and all our luggage in (though we tended to use the stairs on descent). And of course we appreciated the treats we found on arrival — chocolate and champagne!— as well as the eclectic collection of other foods such as pasta and olive oil.  BTW, if you find yourself looking for a restaurant / bar quite close by, we recommend the neighboring urban deli (which has a separate bar and restaurant section as well as a convenient grocery section). We would *not* recommend the restaurant/ bar on the ground floor of the building itself (bad food and glacial service). In sum, we were very happy with our stay in Elisabet’s place, and in the Sodermalm section. We felt lucky to be there.

Peter was not able to come round that night till after 11.30 to discuss the issues, so it was a very unfortunate beginning.  The next day he did remedy this situation and sort the room out, cleaning up the kitchen and shared bathroom as well.  As all 3 rooms were let out almost all the time, there was considerable pressure on the one bathroom, and guests are at the mercy of any inconsiderate house-mates - we had a couple of bad experiences with this although we met several very compatible people. In the end, despite these hassles, the room did suit our purposes and was pleasant to spend time in. The neighbourhood is very convenient and congenial - handy to transport and amenities.  We liked Kungsholmen very much.

Even worse, the bathroom was smelling so bad that it was hardly possible to spend more than required Minute to go to the toilet.

She has H2O in the room, which is nice and there is a comfortable breeze that comes into the room through the window.

I definitely helped myself to some toast with fresh spreads, fresh fruit, and hot tea! It can be quite expensive in Stockholm, so the free breakfast was greatly appreciated. She also gave me some great suggestions of places to check out while I was there. The room I had was very spacious and had plenty of closet/drawer space to put your things away. Large windows for a nice breeze. The listing shows 1.5 baths but I was only shown one bathroom, however that one bathroom was more than sufficient.

There is nothing wrong with the property or location unfortunately we were just very let down by the host for this villa on the first night of a special occasion. A big group us planned a surprise trip for my sisters 40th birthday, unfortunately had our first day and arrival dampened as we were locked out with no help. Our host didn't respond to any of my messages that day so I wasn't sure what was happening for check in. I wasn't too worried as he is a super host and so I was under the impression he was meeting us as he didn't supply any additional details or provide any communication at all that day or the day before for check in at 4pm. We arrived to the house in the rain and thunder and no one was there to meet us and the front door was locked. I tried calling and messaging the host many times with no response at all. It had a coded door so we read the manual on the website and hoped he set the code according to the manual - nothing was set. We were stuck out in the suburbs with our luggage in the rain on a Friday, not an ideal start to a surprise birthday weekend break. Two of our party were pregnant and highly uncomfortable, so I felt awful for them as it is the suburbs there was no where for them to go and sit to wait or use the loo while we sorted out the problem. I called air bnb once I realised we weren't going to hear from our host and they were helpful, my contact was lovely and sympathetic. They were trying to contact the host too with no luck. We tried all the doors and found a side door which luckily wasn't locked and got in the house. We felt a bit uncomfortable going into the house via an unlocked side door but were reassured this was ok by the air bnb help desk. We had to leave our luggage in the house unsecured and unlocked as we had a birthday dinner planned in the city and we didn't want to stay in. We ended up missing our dinner reservations for my sister's birthday party which was disappointing, so we ended up walking around until we found somewhere that would take a big group at that time on a Friday night. We didn't hear from the host until 9pm, which is 5 hours from check in and we finally got a code for the locked front door that we could use the rest of the weekend.

Sadly, we didn't have the best stay at her place and we would have looked for another place to stay if money weren't an issue. While her place is a fine size (there were three of us) and it IS centrally located with GREAT views, there were just some things that really dampened our stay. \n\nFirst and foremost, the place was covered in dust, and like a layer of dust. Everything, even the top of the couch cushions, was covered in dust. I'm allergic to dust so I actually got sick for my entire trip because of it. I was confused at first and thought I was just getting a cold and then I realized my symptoms would lesson when I was out of the house and so I looked closer at the apartment the second day and realized all of the dust. It really sucked. The other big thing was there was an odor in the kitchen that bothered all three of us. It smelled like sewer. Thankfully it was only in the kitchen or we would have had to find another place. But we had rented her apartment for the kitchen so that we could cook and save money. Sadly that was not an option. No one likes to cook and eat their food if the kitchen smells like a dirty bathroom. These two things could have possibly occurred if no one had used the apartment for months. \n\nWe also had communication issues. Before arriving to Sweden and the day we arrived Isabella was AMAZING at communicating with us through airbnb. She would always respond within the hour. Her fiance even picked us up from the airport and she helped us find him when we got lost. They were both very kind and helpful. After we said goodbye to her fiance the communication broke down. There were three of us and she only gave us one set of keys. When we asked for a second set of keys, it took her a full day to respond and another full day to get us the keys. So we had an extra set for our last full day. Sadly it wasn't that helpful. We didn't have international phone plans so I could only talk through email/airbnb so maybe she would have been more responsive through text. \n\nThere were other little things around the apartment that were annoying. The button on the toilet to flush was broken and it actually snapped off my friend's nail. And there were issues with the shower head.

You really can't go wrong."],["wrong","After reading many positive reviews, I was dismayed that my own experience with Siwa ended up the opposite of so many people. Siwa felt controlling about my whole experience, well beyond her rules and role as the host, and repeatedly made negative, unnecessary, and unprofessional comments to me. From day 1, I felt like Siwa had a bone to pick with me, as she repeatedly questioned why I was in Stockholm to begin with and why I even bothered to come. She made several mean comments regarding any of the choices of the activities I was doing. Quite frankly, it’s my vacation, my money, and my time. None of that relates to the Airbnb experience and it is unmistakably not her place to judge what I’m choosing to do on my vacation. I felt like she was actively trying to make me believe my experience was miserable and that I was wasting it, which made me feel horrible every time we had a conversation, like I wasn’t doing enough. To hear comments like that from the host is just downright unprofessional, rude, and uncomfortable to the guest. \nThere were numerous incidents were Siwa was unnecessarily rude and mean to me. Asking to double check how the shower worked was met with scoffs, and calling me stupid and responding with “Don’t they have showers in America!?”. She never shied away from telling me I had no brain power. She never seemed to get over that I had problems with unlocking the door that one time. She repeatedly brought up my failure with the lock to humiliate me for my mistake several times after the incident, questioning how I could lack the brain power. She questioned why I walked everywhere instead of taking public transport. She reprimanded me for not having a fully developed Airbnb profile while boasting about the profile of the next guest after me, as if to say “you’re not good enough”.  She repeatedly thought the jackets I used were inadequate and chastised me for wearing a Columbia Sportswear winter coat, despite the fact it worked perfectly fine for me. She told me I was just flat out wrong, and could not fathom that the jacket I was using was actually fine and has worked for me for years. There was nothing I could that was right in her mind. Most egregiously, she crossed the line when she attacked me and accused me of having no friends and not having any social life back home, because she thought my habits were not normal. There’s a difference between making constructive suggestions versus personally attacking someone and saying they have no friends and no social life. That crossed the line and brought me to tears. The jabs seemed to continue even on the way out, as I had previously explained that I was a history major and she mentioned historians not making any money as I walked out of the apartment.\n\tThe apartment had a great location at least, and it was nice of Siwa to offer food."],["wrong","\"My gf and I were two nights in Stockholm.

Johan svarede lynhurtigt og meget hjælpsomt på vores henvendelser, og vi følte os derfor meget trygge og meget velkomne. Vi kommer meget gerne igen - og vi har stadig meget at opleve i Stockholm. På vores seks dage så vi og kan anbefale fotomuseet (ikke mindst for den smukke udsigt), Abba-museet (vi sang og dansede med de fire medlemmer), Skansen (kombineret Den gamle by/Zoo og Tivoli...og meget svensk!), Moderna Museet (gratis i den permanente afdeling). Vi købte et 7-dages kort til alle offentlige transportmidler, og det sparede os for mange penge. Transportsystemet fungerer upåklageligt, og vi kom hurtigt og nemt omkring.

Tag ikke lyntoget retur til lufthavnen, men benyt samme vej som ved ankomst  ind til byen, altså bus, regionaltog og metro - lyntoget betød et ekstra billettillæg på 120 kr. pr person, øv.

Annette greeted me with a warm welcome & gave me a quick tour to show me everything I needed to know. When I 1st arrived it was Unbearably Hot & I had to open all the windows Because for whatever reason, Stockholm had the hottest summer in over a 100 years & nobody has AC, & every place was sold out of fans. But by the time I left I had to wear my jacket & kept all the windows closed. The weather is crazy! Usually, it's supposed to rain in the summer mostly, but when I was there it didn't rain much at all. Anyway, Annette was so nice to leave me some fruit-- watermelon, kiwi, pineapple, & some wine. The neighborhood/little community is very quiet, but usually the kids will play outside two times a day, so that's the only time it gets noisy. My advice for travelers is to bring an eye mask because the sun RISES AT 3AM!!! So that really messes you up if you're a morning person like me, because my body naturally wakes up as soon as the sun comes up. I had my own eye mask, and Annette had one for me to use too but I used my heavy vest to completely cover my head to block out the light. At night, these little fast-crawling bugs come out, but I think that's just everywhere in Stockholm Because I saw them at the other place I stayed at before I got to Annette's place. Some of her plants started withering so I bought another one because I felt bad that a plant died on me during my stay. Annette didn't ask me/give me any Instructions on watering the plants, so I just gave them some water here & there. I also broke the glass container for water so I replaced it with another one. Overall I had a pleasant stay, but Stockholm is an Expensive place. I think two weeks is good enough to explore the city because there's not much to do besides go museum hopping. The ppl are nice & helpful but it's hard to make friends there. (I attended MANY social gatherings & classes but bumped into familiar faces as well so Stockholm isn't a very big city- you May run into the same people after a while). This is the first time I stayed at an Airbnb that someone lived in, so it was a different experience for me. I think in the future I would prefer to stay at an Airbnb where it's Not someone's full time Home; just because I prefer more privacy. The Laundry is free but you're supposed to \"\"reserve\"\" your time slot for when you want to do your laundry. I never did that though. I just walked in and used it if there was a free machine.

We booked it for 3 nights based on its location, and the fact that it has a washer/dryer (a 2-in-1 unit); since Stockholm was half-way into our 2 week trip, me and the Mrs. just packed a week's worth of clothing, and cleaned our clothes prior to departing. Save the washing machine, the positives are mainly due to location and not the unit itself. Nice looking hotel rooms in Gamla Stan were comparable in price for the nights we stayed, but again, the washing machine was a huge bonus for us. Now for the bad. Two things. (I don't include the loud noise, as it's common to the area and well advised by the friendly owner.) ONE: When we first arrived, it seemed as though the cleaning lady had not finished before leaving. the washing machine was running its drying cycle. There was a squeegee in the middle of the floor. To my disgust, the blue bed sheets were clearly dirty - hair follicles and what appeared to be dried, white stains. I immediately pulled out what was in the laundry machine (a super absorbent bath mat) and cleaned the sheets. I contacted the host on this, and she assured me the sheets were clean. Bollocks. My eyes did not lie to me. The hair and stains were gone after I ran the sheets through the wash. TWO: As other reviewers state, the shower has drainage issues. This could be remedied by a day or 2 of work in fixing the flooring / drainage in the bathroom, or even the sealing / caulking to the shower. I believe this to be solely an income property, and never owner-occupied, so perhaps this is not a pressing issue for the arm's-length owner.

Air circulation was big issue  and it was not an ideal place to sleep. A cupboard door was broken and we ran out of toilet paper. All in all our family did not have a good time in the unit.

The bed is very comfortable and shower’s also good. Possibly one of the most affordable options on Airbnb for a long-term stay in the city (my partner and I stayed for a full month) close to stunning nature.\n\nWhen it comes to minus points, we experienced quite heavy disturbances for two weeks straight coming from the upstairs neighbours (bad luck), which points to a larger issue: our host, owner of the upstairs apartment (and the whole building complex it seems) also hosting the disruptive guests, seemed somehow unwilling to step in to confront the neighbours about their violent/inappropriate behaviour and extremely loud noise. After a number of complaints (we got in touch to see whether we should call the police), we were basically told that given the thin walls of the complex, we were bound to hear what went on elsewhere in the building—so we ended up having to “suck it up”, meaning we spent two weeks being constantly woken up and random hours in the night by other Airbnb guests in the building, which obviously compromised our sleep. In conclusion: if you decide to rent this apartment looking for a relaxing getaway like we did, you may want to pray to the gods so you don’t have to live near such unpleasant or loud people (maybe you’ll be lucky, unlike us). On another note, we had to deep-clean the kitchen cabinets and surfaces ourselves when we checked in, and found used dental floss on the drawer of the bedside table, so cleanliness is another aspect to work with (although the majority of the apartment was okay).

Fake flowers in the apartment could far from give the experience in this residence the necessary boost.  On the contrary.  They were perhaps the most honest accommodation offered to us.  The host claims to have had guests for 3 consecutive years.  In that case, without a service level!  The apartment appears cozy and without any sense to take care of the guest.  The bathroom has mold on the wall, there is dust on the walls and hair around the toilet.  The toilet is running, the water in the faucet must be used with care.  The hot water becomes scalding.  If other travelers use the water in the kitchen while bathing, it will be dangerous for the person taking a bath.  The temperature rises immediately.  A lot of noise from the fridge - around the clock.  The light in the kitchen is flashing so people with epileptic seizures are not advised to book this accommodation.  The TV didn't work either.  There are no or very bad clothing hangers.  I myself host and do not understand why the host does not get new ones.  It could not possibly be an expensive expense.  The radiator is either unbearably hot or cold.  It is not easy to set.  Like much else in this property, it should also get a service check.  Be aware that if you have any changes to the condition of the home, you must stay home!  The host demands you be present.  I had several things reported but expected a responsible host made sure to rectify my complaint points while experiencing Stockholm.  I definitely think one should consider another residence.  Definitely not worth the money.  The host did not respond to my inquiries for up to 15 hours.  Maybe offended, maybe indifferent.  On arrival we found it difficult to find the place, the host was impossible to contact.  Had to contact AIRBNB.  Also, did not receive that link for check-in until I made an inquiry at the time of check-in.  Think the host forgot this.  The area around Gamla Stand is a tourist trap, the experience of this booking was confirmed in this.\n\n\nEn hemsk upplevelse.  Varken mer eller mindre!  Falska blommor i lägenheten kan långt ifrån ge upplevelsen i detta boende det nödvändiga boostet.  Tvärtom.  De var kanske det mest ärliga boendet som erbjuds oss.  Värden påstår sig ha haft gäster i tre år i rad.  I så fall utan servicenivå!  Lägenheten verkar mysig och utan mening att ta hand om gästen.  Badrummet har mögel på väggen, det finns damm på väggarna och håret runt toaletten.  Toaletten går, vattnet i kranen måste användas med försiktighet.  Det heta vattnet blir brännande.  Om andra resenärer använder vattnet i köket under badet, kommer det att vara farligt för den som tar ett bad.  Temperaturen stiger omedelbart.  Mycket ljud från kylen - dygnet runt.  Ljuset i köket blinkar så att personer med epileptiska anfall inte rekommenderas att boka detta boende.  TV: n fungerade inte heller.  Det finns inga eller mycket dåliga klädhängare.  Jag är själv värd och förstår inte varför värden inte får nya.  Det kan inte vara en dyr kostnad.  Kylaren är antingen outhärdligt varm eller kall.  Det är inte lätt att ställa in.  Liksom mycket annat på den här fastigheten bör det också få en servicekontroll.  Var medveten om att om du har några ändringar i hemets skick måste du stanna hemma!  Värden kräver att du är närvarande.  Jag hade rapporterat flera saker men förväntade mig att en ansvarig värd skulle korrigera mina klagomål medan jag upplevde Stockholm  Jag tycker definitivt att man borde överväga en annan bostad.  Definitivt inte värt pengarna.  Värden svarade inte på mina förfrågningar i upp till 15 timmar.  Kanske förolämpad, kanske likgiltig.  Vid ankomsten fann vi det svårt att hitta platsen, värden var omöjlig att kontakta.  Var tvungen att kontakta AIRBNB.  Fick inte heller den länken för incheckning förrän jag gjorde en förfrågan vid incheckningen.  Tror att värden glömde det här.

Given all the positive reviews that came before, what could possibly have gone wrong? \n1) Upon arrival, I found out the bed was broken, and the host had nicely made up the pull-out bed instead. This might not seem like such a big deal, until you realize that the bed is really the most basic and essential thing when paying for accommodation. The co-host and I had been corresponding back and forth in the days and hours leading up to my arrival (he'd been very helpful about other things), but at no point did he feel it necessary to point out that the previous tenant had broken their bed to the point that it was no longer fit to be used, at all. I felt misled. I would have hoped he had informed me of this mishap so as to give me a fair chance to reconsider my booking and to find alternative accommodation without incurring any penalty charges. But he never gave me this chance.\n2) The apartment was dirty. The surfaces were dusty. There were visible food stains on some of the plates and dust on a lot of the glasses. The cooking utensils were sticky. I ran all the kitchenware through the dishwasher in batches (since the dishwasher was very small) and it took a good couple of hours.\n3) The host did not inform me that you need to book a time slot on a specific website in order to access the building's communal laundry machines.

The flat was perfectly located (allowing us to walk quickly to the city center) on a lively place. Also we had access to the pool which was a nice way to relax after a full day of visit. The weak points of the flat are the absence of window blinds and the fact that it is not meant to welcome 4 peoples: there are only 2 seats at the dinning table and the sofa bed was very (very) uncomfortable. In spite of having had bad nights, the overall journey at Adem’s flat was nice."],["bad","First of all, the location of the apartment is superb - you can easily reach all tourist attractions both on foot and by bus and metro (both stations are 2-3 minutes from the apartment), the neighbourhood has many great restaurants and shops. There is also a big grocery store literally 20 m from the entrance, so it is very convenient. The apartment has an excellent view. Both the host and his friend, who let us in the apartment, were friendly and helpful. The apartment has all the basic things you might need - microwave, fridge, towels, etc. However, a few negative sides. If there are only two people staying in the apartment, it is great. The main bed is comfortable and there is enough space for everything. However, additional bed (either the couch or the air mattress) is not the best solution. The sofa isn't comfortable (it's lumpy and you can feel its metallic frame when you sit/lie) and the air mattress deflates as you sleep. It's not something you can't endure for a few nights, but if this problem was solved, the overall experience would be excellent. Also, if you are sensitive to light (especially if you travel in spring/summer), it wouldn't be bad to bring a face mask, since the morning light shines straight into the bedroom (around 4 am at the moment)."],["bad","A pretty great place!

The host reports it as “being an old building” but my boyfriend and I quite literally used public restrooms instead of his. The smell was so bad from pipes and it ruined the experience. That, combined with dirty stained sheets and pillows, dirty dishes, and a weird hodgepodge of items made it uncomfortable. To continue, there’s NO window and NO ventilation. The only option is to open the door in freezing temperatures. It gets so stuffy so fast, and that combined with the bathroom smell makes you sick. Additionally, there’s almost no ease of using things. For example, he allows you to use 2 towels (for two people) before you pay extra. For towels? To clean? The towels given are truly worse than gym towels and stay wet and hurt your skin. He also limits sheets and pillow case usage, which seems.. odd? \n\nAny concerns we had to the host were responded to with a canned response from some member of his “team” a different one each time. Extremely fishy and makes you wonder whats happening.\n\nAnyways, so much went wrong but a little went right. Check in is very easy and the location is superb.

(Gamla stan) in 30 min on foot. \n- Elias is very nice. He did his best to communicate and solve the problems and offered a 30% refund on the payment (excl. cleaning and service fee) \n- There are plenty of restaurants and bars near the building \n\nNegatives:\n- The location is quiet. However the building and neighbors are very noisy. There are lots of noises (even during nights around 2:00 or 3:00) and also construction noises from outside and inside the building. They start from 6:00 in the morning and continue the whole day. We couldn’t sleep at all during the weekdays. I told Elias about it, he tried to talk with the landlord but nothing changed afterwards, he also denied a full refund on the first days, only when just three days were left and after tons of chats with airbnb support he offered it, which made no sense for us at that time. \n- There are not enough bedsheets for 4 people staying. So remember to keep some with you if you are in a bigger group!\n- The internet is not working properly and it is very slow. We faced lots of disconnections and most of the times we were on our cellphone networks.\n- The lift in the house very small (and old). It was stuck 3 or 4 times between the floors during our stay. We saw an old lady stuck inside. So better keep the stairs.\n- There is absolutely no cheap parking places near the building. You can park in front of the building for almost 22 Euros/day.

However, checking in was not easy. I was given this number to contact a guy who is living in the apartment right after made a reservation, and I did through (Hidden by Airbnb) , he replied “okay im waiting for you!”. It was all good until the check in day. I messaged the guy that we are coming at the night twice or three times both in the morning and after when we got in to stockholm, but no response. Already at night, we arrived at the place and called this number several times, still unreachable. About an half hour later he finally responded “who is this?” I had to explain that I booked the room on this day and he said that he forgot that we were coming. The address that is given on here was wrong but walk another 3mins, and we finally got to the apartment. The guy did not expect that we were coming on that night so the room was uncleaned, but he changed the sheets immediately for us. Maybe if I should’ve contacted him much earlier that we are coming on this day, all of this could not have happened.\n\nThe instructions were quite easy and basic nothing special to be careful. Bathroom was spacious and looked nice but there’s no bath mat, and toilet paper was always running out, maybe better buy some. And guests should bring slippers too, the floor is not really clean even you have to take your shoes off.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the stay in Stockholm with great location, (Hidden by Airbnb) respect their privacy too.

Location is excellent and self-serve check-in is convenient. Keycodes for everything and that means no worrying about keys or keycards. I didn't mind the stairs, but if you are not very physical, then you might struggle hauling your luggage - there is no help available or lift.\n\nApartment is modern and clean. High ceilings as well, which is unusual for the area, and even though my window faced out onto the courtyard/faced the Hilton, it let in a good amount of light (or as much as exists in Sweden during November)...\n\nBed was comfortable, but if you don't like a firmer mattress, or are heavier person, you might find it uncomfortable. Nice and clever separation between bedroom, living space, bathroom and kitchen makes the apartment feel bigger than what it is and like you are in an apartment and not a hotel room.\n\nThe kitchen is reasonable only because there is no oven. This was annoying as I cook a lot of meat, so instead had to get into blanching, which was fine to put up with the for month's stay. Also no colander/sieve, which is ridiculous considering you only have a hob for cooking. That means boiling everything and then draining it. I had to go out and buy one.\n\nKitchen is a bit cramped juggling cooking and cleaning dishes using the supplied collapsible drainer and is really only suitable for one person and not two. Fridge works well and is spacious. Microwave is modern and works well. The extractor fan is powerful, but not obvious how to use - you need to grab the outside edge and pull it towards you. It's a smart and compact design.\n\nShower room is nice. There is underfloor heating and it's always very warm. Hot water never an issue. Good pressure. Includes hairdryer for those who need it, plus towels and basic toiletries.\n\nApartment itself, despite minus temperatures on some nights, was always warm. I worked from my apartment most days and I was never close to shivering.

Je mag haar altijd alles vragen en daar geeft ze ook graag antwoord op. Aan het begin van ons verblijf heeft ze ons allemaal tips gegeven over wat er te zien is in Stockholm en na het horen van onze voorkeuren wist ze nog wat meer specifieke tips te geven, waardoor ons verblijf in Stockholm zeker beter is geworden! In het verblijf zelf zijn de meubels wat oud, maar er hangt wel een hele gezellige sfeer. De badkamer is erg schoon en de douche is verrassend lekker. De bedden sliepen heerlijk en ook had Li er zelf al voor gezorgd dat er genoeg stopcontacten waren. Al met al een heerlijk verblijf hier gehad en we zouden het zeker aanraden!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een fijne, nette kamer met mooi uitzicht, maar de gordijnen laten wel veel licht door. Denk daaraan, als je in de lente/zomer gaat. De badkamer is ruim en de douche is heel goed, meteen warm water. Dat het toilet niet apart is, is soms wat lastig, als er andere gasten zijn en je dus moet wachten. Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. \nIn de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. \nLi antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.

Kitchen was not clean (oven in real bad shape) old refrigerator  toaster  ultra small old microwave all in bad conditions, furniture including sofas and rugs are very warn  sitting in front of a window without curtains, facing  neighbors, iron not functioning.\r\nThe owner replaced old pots that we had scratched clean but this was not enough to make us feel comfortable.\r\nSome art is  extreme and too explicit, dark religious, and of sexual unnecessary display.We are liberal adults who love art but that was really too much.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location of the apartment was very convenient. It is quite large and spacious however it is not a three bedroom apartment. There is one functioning bedroom that has a closet. The other small room does not have a closet or dresser and there is no place to put your clothes. The third Bedroom is the library which does not have a bed or closet space for clothing. \nMy husband and I and a family friend were in Sweden for our daughters wedding. We were all very respectful and cautious with the apartment. So we were stunned to come home to a scathing email accusing us of miscellaneous damages! The owner claimed that we had damaged the window sills by opening the windows but they were certainly damaged and old when we arrived.  There was a horrific heatwave so of course we needed to open windows\nShe suggested that someone had vomited on her carpet which left us completely speechless! She accused us of breaking a piece of coral in her window sill which we never touched. There are all kinds of knickknacks all over the place and some are in very bad condition.\nI would suggest that you do not rent this apartment if you have any intention of using the kitchen. The owner has just installed a marble countertop that is extremely susceptible to damage. We were very cautious using the kitchen but we’re still accused of damaging the countertop.\nAlso do not invite some of your adult relatives over for dinner as you’ll be accused of being a partier! We are  mid 60s and it’s been quite a long time since we’ve been considered party people. \nSo to return from such a special trip And to have this very upsetting email demanding a significant amount of money to repair things that we did not damage and threatening to report to Airbnb that we are horrible people and do not belong in the community.

It's a small room and not a studio which makes it cosy.\r\n\r\nThe toilet is very small and doesn't have a shower space, there is a metal provider which you can use to limit the water going everywhere but sadly it's not the most efficient and you still end up with a very wet toilet floor which you would need to sweep using a small hand sweeper which means you have to bend to sweep the floor which was difficult for me as I have a bad back. \r\n\r\nThe building is an amazing building from 1930s I believe but this means that the drains are not the best which translated into our room constantly smelling badly from the toilet drains. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Based off the other reviews regarding the kitchen and bathroom, we were a bit hesitant to check it out for ourselves. However, to our surprise everything was great and really, all you need for two people. The shower was a bit cramp, but it wasn't any worse than a hostel shower or small Japanese bathroom. The location of Karl's place was probably the best aspect and well worth the price paid. It was close to grocery stores, gyms, coffee shops (for Fika!) and of course Old Town.

The only bad thing about my stay here is that it didn't last longer!\r\n\r\nLina is also a great host.  She left us a super handy map of the immediate area with her restaurant and shopping recommendations.  She made sure we were taken care of and quickly answered any questions we had, even though she was on vacation herself.  She went above and beyond in numerous other tiny ways, too.  Basically, she's the perfect airbnb host!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I really can't recommend this apartment highly enough.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastic airbnb in a quiet street yet close to everything. Located in the best part of hip Sodermalm, and a short walk to Gamla Stan (though we personally preferred the less touristy Sodermalm, in addition to day trips to Vaxholm in the archipelago, time spent at Centralbadet in Normalm, etc.) Lina met us to give us personalized suggestions when we arrived. There are 3 grocery stores a block away, many thrift shops on a nearby street, very convenient. Flexible self checkout on our last day. The apt is of course beautiful with the kitchen having a view of the street where you can see the sunset and the living room having a view to lovely courtyard.

All the wardrobes and shelves were full of clothes and every storage space was filled.  Both bathrooms had dirty towels in them and the dishwasher was full of dishes which were clean.  There were medications and personal items left all over the place.  We were there for 4 nights but had nowhere to hang our clothes or shelves to store anything.  The bedding was suspect - hope it was all clean but was definitely in need of pressing.  The upstairs bedroom had at least 10 large cartons stacked against one of the walls - everywhere was messy.  It was very disappointing!  On the plus side it was warm, clean and well located with plenty of shops and restaurants around.  We did not see Max at all during our stay and I am not surprised.

En pump väsnades varje gång man använde badrummet.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>First of all, I want to thanks God that we are in a good health. It was our first time when we didn’t like the apartment at all. I am very upset to write that but this will help somebody in future. This is not an apartment as we thought, it is actually a basement (even a cellar), I could easily touch the ceilings by my head (I am not too tall). This basement has only one window that could be opened (but only for 5-10 cm), it has only two windows and the second one is covered with mold!!! I now the reason, but it must to be eliminated. The main reason is that this place doesn’t have heating at all!!!! There is an air-conditioner but it isn’t enough for a such cold place! There is a heat-insulated floor at the entrance, but it is one meter length-ways. The air-conditioner couldn’t reach the bathroom and the bed (you don’t have bedroom, it is right behind the cold wall). But the most terrifying things were THE SOUNDS! You can’t sleep due to loud sounds of the water system (I don’t know exactly what it was). We would never rent the «sharing» apartment in a basement or a cellar (even if I am a big fan of Harry Potter). The bathroom (the bath cabin) is moldy too, and it is need to be replace due to its old conditions. There was no soap neither in the kitchen nor in the bathroom (so we pour the shower gel). How stiff were the towels, like wooden.  The bed was cold and awful! We left with backache. And I am wonder, how old is the washcloth?\nBTW, the Internet was awful too!\nThe location is perfect, but you won’t be able to admire this panoramic view from the apartment, it is wrong and confusing idea. It is 30 min from the old city center but we knew it, it is okay.\nWARNING! If you are choosing «Entire place» in the Airbnb, check it because you may leave under somebody.\nIt is a case when the hosts want to get money but don’t want to do everything properly. Even the pan was in a bed condition (it couldn’t be damaged by gests because the place has an electric stove, and the damage is like from the gas stove). In Ukrainian we say «зроблено абияк, лише щоб відчепилися».\nThree words: cold, dirty, bаd WIFI.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Javier is an awesome and funny guy to show you around the night scene in Cuba. Hes very friendly and knows the best places in Havana. He was also very accommodating and flexible with me. If you're looking for a fun night, you cant go wrong hanging out with Javier! Until next time!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a very good impression og Mikael from the first moment! He answered my request and questions very promptly and meet us when we arrived and put himself to our disposition to explain about the apartment and area. The apartment was very bright and welcoming. The place is very central and with good access to transportation, even to take the shuttle bus to the airport. The bad was a bit o soft for me, but I'm used to a hard mattress! I can warmly recommend this nice place to stay some days exploring stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wij hebben Thomas’ Airbnb zes nachten gehuurd voor ons eerste vakantie in Zweden.\n\nWij ontvingen onderweg aardige berichtjes, en de verrassing dat er wat kleine boodschappen waren gehaald. Zo was er vers brood, boter, melk, bier, yoghurt, limonade en wat ijsjes. Echt heel aardig en super handig voor de eerste avond en ochtend.\n\nMijn vrouw, twee volwassen kinderen en ikzelf, vonden ons verblijf een groot succes.\nHet is namelijk een schoon, opgeruimd, net, ruim, koel, prettig ingedeeld appartement.Precies zoals de foto’s en de beschrijving op de site vertellen. \n\nTwee ruime slaapkamers, een ruime badkamer met douche, bad, toilet en wasmachine. Verder is er een ruime woonkamer met open keuken en een prima eetgedeelte.\n\nWe hebben een aantal keer gekookt. En als wat je nodig hebt om te koken, is aanwezig. Onze dochter wilde wat strijken, en er is zelfs een strijkijzer.\n\nOok vonden wij het fijn dat dit een echt gastenverblijf is, dat goed afgesloten en gescheiden is van de privé woning van Thomas’ gezin. Extra verrassing was dat we de privé tuin en terras ook mochten gebruiken. Thomas was zelf een weekje weg, maar kon binnen drie kwartier terug rijden als dat nodig zou zijn.\n\nAl met al een echte aanrader.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wir haben als Familie (2 Erwachsene, 2 Kinder 6+12J) im August 2020 5 Nächte in der Wohnung verbracht. Wenngleich die Wohnung nicht in der Innenstadt liegt, so ist das Zentrum von Stockholm mittels Bus und Metro in ca. 40 Minuten zu erreichen. Die Wohung liegt in einem sehr ruhigen Wohngebiet. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten bestehen in Fruängen, das man mit dem Bus in wenigen Minuten erreicht. Die Kinder haben es genossen, nach dem Sightseeing noch im nahe gelegenen See baden zu können.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a great little apartment on a beautiful island in Stockholm. I have lived in a few different places around the city and this was my favorite. It is a peaceful spot that isn't far outside of the city. The apartment itself has everything you need and the breakfast foods were a nice touch that not many AirBnB hosts throw in. Definitely appreciated. This is a great spot to base your Stockholm adventures out of. You can tour the city, and when you return home you won't feel bad spending lazy time close to home on this super peaceful island. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice little appartement, on a pretty little island.\r\nEverything you need is there, and Carl e-mailed us all the details.\r\nHe even let us use a free city bike card (which is a must have in Stockholm). Bikes are available next to the bus stop, cards are sold a little bit further tho.\r\n\r\nThe island is cool and quiet, you can jogg around it, and even swimm if the water is not too cold!\r\n\r\nToo bad we didn't have a chance to meet Carl, but i recommend him as a host, as everything went fine!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>After we took a wrong turn on the way to Carl's apartment and came and were running a bit late, he waited patiently, let us in and showed us the flat. Everything was as expected and we had a very pleasant stay on our 4-day trip to Stockholm!\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Small studio well agenced, warm and cute.\r\n\r\nNothing wrong to report, except that our travel was too short and that the weather was not shiny (in november (hahaha)).\r\n\r\nKlara gave us the key in the main train station and sent us indications to find easily our place. Don't forget the shampoo ans something too eat in the morning (there is a teakettle, some tea and coffee you can buy it in the subway's shop)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot =)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment is my new favorite place to stay in Stockholm (and I already had another hostess I loved). The location is excellent, in a fun and lively neighborhood, 2 minutes from the subway and a good supermarket, not to mention bars, shops and a major theater. The space is easily 3x as large as I'd expected, full of windows and skylights - plus the porch, which bad weather sadly kept me away from. The kitchen is well equipped, the bed is very comfortable, and Annika is a kind and attentive hostess -- conveniently just downstairs if you need her! Only 2 small warnings: 1) this is an attic apartment in a 4-story walk-up building on a hilltop; and 2) if you need a dark room to sleep, consider bringing an eye mask -- there are shades, of course, but also skylights. Overall, an A-quality spot. Will be back.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lite besvike.. lät bättre än det var..\r\nlägenheten hyste flera uthyrda rum till olika personer\r\nena kvällen hade det andra gästerna party.. inte så roligt\r\n\r\nstår rökfritt i presentationen..  rummet stank dock rök när jag kom\r\nbadrummet var ordentligt smutsigt..\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Værten var ude at rejse, mens vi var i Stockholm, men han var hjælpsom via mail.\r\nJeg var skuffet over, at vi var 3 Airbnb-familier i samme lejlighed (i 3 værelser med 2 personer i hvert) - til eet badeværelse. Jeg havde forventet, at vi ville være de eneste gæster.\r\nKvarteret er behageligt og roligt. Der er et stykke at gå til centrum, men vi lejede cykler og så fungerer det helt fint.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Peter was a nice guy!\r\n\r\nEverything was like he says in the description of the room, so there where no bad surprises!\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood has supermarkets and anything you need. And you can also walk everywhere to the centre and so on easily in 10 min.\r\n\r\nAll in all a nice place to stay :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We feel really comfortable in Peter's house.Although the weather has been bad in those days so that we did not enjoy the nice sunny balcony.We are still very happy and the location is really great.Peter is very nice and kind as well.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Värden var lättillgänglig och flexibel ordnade bra med in och utcheckningen. Det var ett bra läge , tyst rymligt rum in mot gård. Bra säng  bäddat och fräscht. Däremot var det ostädat och avloppssdoft i badrum.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The description matches the actual situation quite well. There are some euphemizations here and there but nothing outrageous. However, it is interesting to know that all the rooms in the appartment are rented out here on Airbnb. Regardless whether that's something good or bad, it means that there will probably be more people staying than the appartment was designed for, which can lead to annoying queueing at the bathroom in the morning. Peter himself remained physically invisible during the entire process, but was responding quickly to questions asked by e-mail. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The location is good and the room is like it's written in the description, it's big and comfortable but it's not clean. Dust was everywhere on the furnitures and on the floor. We had to clean it ourselves to put our stuff. The bathroom is awful, smelly, not clean and what is worse is shared with all the people in the house, which can be 7 or 8 (it depends) and this is NOT clear in the description. We never met Peter but the communication with him was prompt. He rents the whole house to AirBnB guests, means 3 rooms totally 7 or 8 people and this is not in the spirit of Airbnb. Usually we go thru Airbnb to meet the owner of the house, talk to him, enjoy some common experiences and especially get infos about the city where we travel. This is not the case at Peter's place. The kitchen is big and you can have a nice breakfast there, but again it is not clean. Everything is left to the guests, so if you are lucky to find other guests who are clean, then it's ok, otherwise pity for you.... I think the owner, even if he doesn't live in the house, has to come and clean (at least the bathroom) and check if everything is fine, otherwise it looks like you are in an hostel. The smelly bathroom has a shower which is at the same level of the floor, so water is everywhere when you take a shower and you need to dry the pavement by yourself. This is my first bad experience at Airbnb after so many years! I don't recommend this appartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>it was not bad and the location was amazing. But you have to share kitchens and bathrooms with at least 5 people.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Appartement prima voor paar dagen. Vraag de kamer met balkon die is het fijnst! Prima keuken. Je moet t geen probleem vinden om de badkamer te delen. En geluk hebben met rustige mede gasten, en dat hadden wij dus prima! Lokatie is perfect en leuke buurt. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The flat is really nice and it is well located to visit Stockholm. Too bad it was freezing to properly enjoy the balcony</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Peter is a really great host, but the stay itself was pretty bad. We weren’t told that there would be other guests in the apartment until after we had already booked and to top that off, they started having really loud sex in the next room. The walls are paper thin and you can’t even talk at regular volume without it going through the walls, let alone having loud sex or guests coming in after midnight being extremely noisy and rude. It makes sleeping and relaxing difficult. The room itself wasn’t very clean. The floor had a lot of dust and whatnot on it and it smelled strongly of smoke even though it says no smoking in the room. The bathroom reeked the entire time we were there. It was almost unbearable sometimes to use it. There was also the start of mold on the bathroom wall.  We definitely would not stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location of this accommodation was perfect, just 2-4 subway stations to the central station. Peter was always helpful and kind. The room was enough for 2 persons provided it has a balcony, the only bad part was that the bathroom was not quite clean and the sink (which was also pretty dirty) and the shower was clogged and there was a bad smell generally in the bathroom.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"We loved to spend five days at the place of Maud!\r\n\r\nThe apartment is like the photos. The purple room is tidy and cosy. The neighbourhood is very quiet and beautiful (especially the docks during sunset!) with a big supermarket close.\r\n\r\nAt Maud's, everything is at our disposal for feeling like home and it works! \r\n\r\nThe cleanliness is flawless, it's hard to believe that two cats live here because there is never cat hairs on the floor or litter odor. \r\n\r\nMaud is the kindest person in the world and we already regret not staying longer. She is really the best Airbnb host you can find.\r\n\r\nSammy and Dione are adorable. They are both soft and cute and Sammy loves playing!\r\n\r\nThis Airbnb experience was perfect. The only  \"\"bad point\"\" is that Maud  will really miss us. \"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was BRILLIANT \nThe communication before the stay was perfect - Maud was so helpful and responsive. She even waited quite late at night because we took the wrong metro.\n\nWhen we arrived, Maud was patiently giving us all practical information about the house. They were even written too, so it was really handy!\n\nAbout the room - it was super clean and well-equipped. Couldn't have asked for more.\n\nOverall, the stay was perfect and even better than staying in a hotel. Thank you so much for the hospitality, Maud and Sammy! It was really nice meeting you. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wir, Familie mit Tochter Studentin, haben während unseres Stockholm Aufenthaltes 5 Tage in Sandras Appartement gewohnt. Das Appartement ist skandinavisch schick eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Sandra hat extra Platz freigeräumt in Schränken und Kühlschrank. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Appartment liegt etwas ausserhalb, die Innenstadt ist aber mit Bus, der alle10 min fährt, super gut zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle ist 3 min von der Unterkunft entfernt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohnviertel. Besonders gut hat uns die Badetelle gefallen, die auch in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen ist. Wir haben jeden Tag gebadet. Ein Traum mitten in einer Großstadt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We were very happy with Peters accommodation. Easy to find, close to everything needed and cosy. Too bad we didn´t meet him due to bad timing. Hopefully next time :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het is een prima plek om vanuit Stockholm te verkennen. Het is goed om je te realiseren dat de keuken en badkamer worden gedeeld. Alles was schoon en het was een goed bed. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This is a delicate situation because Peter's place is wonderful (without bed bugs).  We had fun meeting other travellers.  The kitchen is a great common space to sit and mingle.  Where things started going wrong is when we discovered bed bug bites.  It was only after 2 nights and 30+ bites that we wrote to Peter about the issue.  He was completely open and honest, divulging that our room had bed bug issues in the recent past.  He said the room was treated, though we have a hard time believing that.  We were also displeased with the way in which he handled the situation, especially for an AirBnB business owner.  We are saddened to have to divulge this publicly but feel the need to share with others.  Once we presented the problem to Peter, we felt no pro-active manner to 'fix' the problem.  He offered to change the sheets at 11pm before bed time.  Anyone who knows anything about bed bugs, knows that changing the sheets will do nothing at all.  Especially when you have 10 hungry bugs lying across the baseboard behind the bed.  The fear of sleeping in that room another night was tainted with the thought of being covered by multiple bugs in our sleep.  Peter needs to take ownership as a businessman before continuing to offer his services to other travellers.  We know that 5* hotels can be plagued by this, so the actual issue is not the bed bugs - rather the way the situation was handled.  We had to ask to be refunded for the last night's stay and had to fight with AirBnB to get our money back.  We did not make further claims for the money spent on washing our clothes, bug spray for the itch and pain and spray for our luggage.  Our experience went from a 5* to a 1*</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room is very well positioned for exploring the amazing Stockholm. No bad surprises in the room - beds are comfy, you can lock the door for privacy and the heat is warm - and both the kitchen and the bathroom are big and have everything you may need to use. If you are considering this place for your trip in Stockholm, book it, you will not regret!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Peter is amazing host, very nice and kind and was willing to help with everything. The apartment is situated in walking distance from city centre, is big and clean. I have nothing bad to say about the place and I fully recommend it to everybody, who is travelling and needs a place to stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is too expensive for what it is:\n- we were 3 people and luckily we had only 1 suitcase. There is not enough place to rent this room for 3 people. 2 people is the maximum\n- the sheets and shower were dirty\n- maybe we did not have chance but the other people (from airbnb) in the flat were loud\n- there is only 1 bathroom (with no separate toilets) for 6? 8? people\n\nIn general the stay was not bad because we were out of the flat... but the instructions to arrive and the communication were very good</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Only book this if you’re in it for the hostel-feel. \nBad value for the money! \n\nHost doesn’t live in the apartment. The apartment is only rented out to other Airbnb-guests which makes the place feel like a hostel/a central train station! \nVery thin walls - we almost didn’t get any sleep since the 3 guys in one of the rooms talked till 1.30am and the couple in the other room started making noise at 4.45am..... \nThe apartment is in bad shape as well. Very beaten and dirty. \nWe are not used to luxury but the pictures are not a correct image of the apartments actual shape and we would never have booked it if we had known we would be 8 people sharing one apartment (and one bathroom!) \nHost should be more honest about what he is renting out. Both in price and in the description. \nThe sunny balcony is not private and has to be accessed through a window.....</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, super close to a metro station. Plenty of shops and places to eat nearby as well. You do have a chance of having other Airbnb users being in the same space, in their own separate rooms obviously, but if you don’t mind meeting it’s definitely not bad at all.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>great place! comfortable for two people although not much space to spare other than the beds... but if you are hanging out in bed in stockholm youre doing it the wrong way! neighborhood is residential and not in the middle of typical tourist stuff but stockholm has one of the world's best transport systems so as long as you can handle that its perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed a few days at Kajje's place. The flat is just like as descriped and very well located. \nKajje was very nice even after my very bad arrival time estimation and gave me recommendations about what to do in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>To fine soverom med gode senger og godt sengetøy. Eget bad var topp. Balkongen til soverommet var en koselig plass med gode solforhold. Verten er vennelag og behjelpelig. Vi takker for oss</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This experience was not as rewarding as we hoped, for several reasons:\n1.The host lives in the apartment upstairs, but the same entrance is used for both apartments , and this is not specified in the rules . \n2.Because of this, we were concerned about our privacy, but we were replied that we’re not in a hotel , and we got enough privacy in our rooms. \n3.The nearby kindergarten implies a lot of noise in the morning.\n4.The TV was not operational, the host proposed that we might fix it.. that was not ok, as the TV was included in the facilities.\n5.Squeaky doors make a lot of noise, and the 22.00 -silence rule makes you feel bad for using the doors at night..\n6.Again, the same 22.00-silence rule prohibits us from coming home late , but we went to Sweden especially for the sunny nights, with only 3 hours of dark. The silence rule doesn’t work the other way around, as the host was noisy at 6 in the morning, unloading the dishwasher.\n7. We couldn’t use the blinds or windows without her help, as they were next to breaking. We needed shade and air, as the summer came earlier in Sweden.\n8. No lit lights in the downstairs hallway because that disturbs her sleep *in the upstairs apartment..??*.\n9. Overall, not a friendly host, declining lots of things we proposed. I don’t get it, why would you offer your apartments for rent to strangers, if you don’t want to get along with them. \n10.The included breakfast was apparently not included, because we got a discounted price. I didn’t know you can pick your offer on Airbnb… At least we could use the kitchen, again, under specific restrictions.. \n\nConclusion : I don’t recommend this host , read all the reviews, there have been several other people encountering the same problems. We are a family of 4 responsible adults, but we were seen as kids that could break anything. We paid good money but the conditions definitely did not pay off.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Boendet är uppdelat i 2 delar. Vi var 4 st som hyrde undervåningen, med balkong kök och badrum och två rymliga sovrum.\nBra läge och nära till det mesta i centrala Stockholm.\nTrevlig host som ger dig snabba svar på dina frågor.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It's easy to be a great host when there are no set-backs, it is much harder to be a great host when something goes wrong. Hakan, showed that he can be a great host even when things are difficult.\n\nDuring my stay Hakan was taking care of a beautiful long haired cat, an old lady, that he took over from friends. She was very shy and didn't really interact much. During the first night however, she woke me up just before dawn. Once she realised that I was in the room, she disappeared again, and I didn't really mind. When I told the story in the morning Hakan apologised, she hadn't done this before, and Hakan promised to take her into his room for the night. The next nights went by without further events. If you have allergies, ask Hakan, because it isn't sure she will stay living with him. \n\nBesides this everything was perfect, Hakan's flat is well located, very close to a metro stop ( (Hidden by Airbnb) maps would have you walk around a block, but you don't need to as there is a stairway shortcut). This was my 2nd time at Hakan's place, and I will be back for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Håkan and Guan (spelled wrongly I guess) were great hosts. I stayed five nights and their place and would recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfect gelegen appartement in een leuke buurt. Heel gezellige woonkamer en slaapruimte, perfect voor 2 personen. Enige minpunt hier was dat de gordijnen zeer veel licht doorlieten (het ene rolgordijn was kapot). De badkamer was verouderd, de douchekop houder was kapot en het douchescherm liet een beetje water door. De badkamer kon misschien iets properder maar was nog steeds zeker in orde. De keuken was enorm klein, weinig plaats om dingen weg te zetten (de kasten stonden nogal vol met gerief). \r\nSissela was een zeer vriendelijke en correcte verhuurdster en antwoordde zeer snel op alle vragen. Toplocatie om stockholm te ontdekken en gezellig appartementje!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a comfortable stay at Sissela's apartment. Here is my assessment of the place:\nLocation: 4/5. It's fairly central (very close to a metro stop) and quiet but about a 15 min walk from the trendy restaurants and bars. The area around Östermalmstorg would be better for those things, but this apartment is better if you are looking for a quiet, family-friendly place. \nCommunication: Sissela was away so she put me in touch with her girlfriend, who was very prompt with messaging. The only slight issue was that she was in a rush when I arrived and left me with the keys from outside, so I didn't get introduced to the apartment. This wasn't a problem because Sissela had left some instructions inside. \nInstructions: They were useful but not exhaustive. You have to rely on your common sense, which is not a bad thing, of course.\nFurnishing: Tastefully decorated, I think. Very pleasant. The bathroom is in renovation and I had a small problem with the window - the chord for the blind broke when I tried to pull it up. The blinds are a bit dated and in need to updating. All minor problems that can be easily fixed. The kitchen is small and enclosed, so not ideal for a lot of cooking. I didn't want to cook and this was fine. \nI was impressed by Sissela's book collection. She appears to be a smart person. I hope to meet her next time. This means that I approve of her place and would stay again, but Sissela, please fix your blinds!\nPS: The apartment does not have wi-fi, but I did connect to an open wifi. Not sure if it was a public one or someone's private wifi.\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>great host to deal with, was very responsive from start to finish. everything came as advertised on the listing.\r\nlocation location location!  even though this was not at gamla stan or the 'city centre' but it is just a stone throw away. 10 minute walk at most into gamla stan and another 10 to the city centre; then again the solderman area has everything to offer for shopping and food. the only one hiccup was the elevator didnt work on the day we arrived but host had someone come to repair it immediately but too bad not before we arrived.  all in all, highly recommend!  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Marina ist eine sehr liebenswerte, lustige Person - das Zimmer ist sehr sehr wohnlich und man fühlt sich sofort zuhause. Alles ist sehr ordentlich hergerichtet und sauber. Das Bad ist zwar klein, aber reicht vollkommen aus. Es gibt genügend Handtücher, Seife, Duschbad, schöne Blumen, eine Soundanlage, indirektes Licht.\r\nDie Lage ist unschlagbar, bis zur Central Station sind es nur entspannte 10 Minuten oder weniger und 50 Meter entfernt gibt es niedliche Bars, Café's, Restaurants und sogar einen deutschen Bäcker.\r\nPerfekt für 2 Reisende, die Stockholm erkunden wollen oder nur auf Durchreise sind.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Je voelde je erg welkom, de kamer was huiselijk, schoon en goed verzorgd met een eigen badkamertje. je kreeg een huissleutel, zodat je makkelijk in en uit kon en ze gaf je privacy. Het ligt super centraal. Je krijgt waar voor je geld.\r\nWel lastig dat er geen lift is, dat betekent 3 trappen op.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>En dejlig velkomst: frisk frugt på bordet og varme på radiatoren. Jeg har nydt dagene i denne skønne lejlighed, som jeg finder charmerende, autentisk og med en behagelig hjemlig atmosfære og fuldt funktionel i et rart og roligt nabolag tæt på det hele. Og god detalje, at der er eget bad og toilet.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Elisabet’s place is spacious, well-appointed, clean, and full of light and air. The strong cross breeze is a welcome feature. The decor is pleasingly minimalist. Elisabet kindly allowed us to check in late, due to our 11 PM arrival (thank you!). Although we didn’t meet Elisabet because of the automatic check in and check out, we really appreciated the responsiveness and streamlined clarity of her Airbnb messaging— both before and during our stay. Her instructions, like the decor, were smartly minimalist and efficient. She trusted our ability to figure out how things work rather than needlessly spelling them out. The amenities were great. The combination washer/dryer was very welcome (we were even able to find an English manual for it online, so using it was no problem). The deck was probably the highlight for us. It faces onto an internal courtyard, basically an enclosed square formed by the backs of multiple apartment buildings and containing bike racks and other useful elements. We felt like residents sitting on the deck eating, drinking, observing, and unwinding. The retractable awning (which blocks both sun and rain) expanded the times of day when we could enjoy the deck. As for the neighborhood, Sodermalm is one of the hippest areas in Stockholm and is conveniently located (with easy access to other areas of the city). Despite the flight of many Stockholm residents to the countryside for the entire month of July, the vibe was still plenty animated for us. The apartment itself, by contrast, was very quiet. Even with the windows open for the cross breeze, the surroundings were generally pretty chill sound-wise. Note that, although the kitchen windows and deck face the internal courtyard, the windows on the opposite side of the apartment (in the living room and bedroom) give a wonderful view of a church steeple and include a playground and other interesting urban areas. Other standouts: the elevator was quite convenient— we were able to fit two people and all our luggage in (though we tended to use the stairs on descent). And of course we appreciated the treats we found on arrival — chocolate and champagne!— as well as the eclectic collection of other foods such as pasta and olive oil.  BTW, if you find yourself looking for a restaurant / bar quite close by, we recommend the neighboring urban deli (which has a separate bar and restaurant section as well as a convenient grocery section). We would *not* recommend the restaurant/ bar on the ground floor of the building itself (bad food and glacial service). In sum, we were very happy with our stay in Elisabet’s place, and in the Sodermalm section. We felt lucky to be there. Thank you for a lovely stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not a bad experience but I think that Peter should take more care of some important things as to throw out the waste boxes daily and not each  4/5 days.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>When we arrived very late at the address, we were dismayed to find that the room we had booked and prepaid for 13 nights bore little resemblance to the advertised picture, and the whole place was very grubby.  Peter was not able to come round that night till after 11.30 to discuss the issues, so it was a very unfortunate beginning.  The next day he did remedy this situation and sort the room out, cleaning up the kitchen and shared bathroom as well.  As all 3 rooms were let out almost all the time, there was considerable pressure on the one bathroom, and guests are at the mercy of any inconsiderate house-mates - we had a couple of bad experiences with this although we met several very compatible people. In the end, despite these hassles, the room did suit our purposes and was pleasant to spend time in. The neighbourhood is very convenient and congenial - handy to transport and amenities.  We liked Kungsholmen very much.  It was our first Airbnb experience and we will learn from this.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>First of all, Peter was answering all questions and comments via airbnb very quick - great responsiveness. His explanation how to get to the appartment was good and we found easily our way. Also, the appartment is very central and we could reach everything easily by foot or via public transportation.\r\nThe room and bed was clean and tidy, and there are towels and a hairdryer available. \r\nUnfortunately, the bathroom wasn't that clean. Even worse, the bathroom was smelling so bad that it was hardly possible to spend more than required Minute to go to the toilet. I guess there is something wrong with the general wastewater system of the house, but it was really bad. And, depending on the load factor of the flat you have to share the bathroom with 6-8 People. Also the kitchen could need a basic cleaning.\r\nFurthermore, Peter doesn't live in the flat and we didn't see him once - this is simply not the intention of airbnb.   </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great room in a great place. Peter was very cooperative and was always making sure, that everything works as it was planned. He was professional and we experienced no bad surprises. Had a great trip!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I don't like to say that but I felt very disapointed with that room. It is NOT what you can see in the pictures, looks more like an storage room with a bed inside than the cozy room you can see. The room is in an apartment with two more rooms for guests (Peter it's not living there), so you will have to share the only bathroom and kitchen with 4 more persons. \r\n\r\nIf you don't care about how is the room and share the apartment with other people, it's not a bad option. All the other services are as descrived.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mooi appartement op loopafstand van de metro en bus. Beetje stoffig en er hangt een wat vreemde geur in de keuken. Verder jammer dat je met nog 2 kamers de badkamer deelt. Prima verblijf gehad en zeer vriendelijke verhuurder.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Great communication, and that's about it. The place is worse than a cheap motel. Constant traffic in and out. The furniture is extremely outdated. The bathroom is disgusting. Nothing new to add beyond what some of the other previous guests mentioned in their reviews. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Well located appartment with all supplies you need. We had the room second door right. When you opened the windows, what was necessary cause of the bad air inside, it was very loud. The whole place was very dirty, so we vacuumed it and cleaned the bathroom before we could feel comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Franks lägenhet har ett fantastiskt läge, nära till bussar, tunnelbana, restauranger, allt! Frank var väldigt trevlig och visade oss runt i lägenheten och berättade bland annat hur bäddsoffan funkade. Vi fick även förmånen att träffa Franks son som även entusiastiskt visade oss runt. Trots att lägenheten ligger precis vid en större väg, var det knäpptyst i lägenheten, vilket var väldigt skönt. Ett stort plus var även badkaret som barnen älskade att nyttja. En superbra vistelse!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Excellent location at a great price. Jonas was extremely helpful giving us an overview of the city on a map and marked all the places we should see. Great host overall, cant go wrong with this place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Linda is a great host.\r\nShe made contact with us before the trip and gave clear directions of how to get to her flat. She left a letter for us in her flat as she couldn't be there on our arrival, but she also made sure we had settled in ok and kept contact with us to make sure we were finding everything ok.\r\n\r\nThe flat is amazing. It's perfect for a couple. Very clean. The décor is lovely and perfectly Scandinavian! - you feel like you're living like a local while staying here. The bed is really comfortable (so long as you're ok with ladders, which we don't have a problem with), and we had the best sleep in this bed of our whole holiday!\r\nKitchen is well equip and we made all our dinners and breakfasts in there.\r\nBathroom is large, clean and it has a really good shower in there.\r\n\r\nWe even stayed in one night when it rained really badly, and had a great time just chilling and having a few drinks in her apartment. I wasn't even disappointed we didn't make it to a bar because we got so comfortable.\r\n\r\nGood transport links and not far to walk to some of the main sights of Stockholm.\r\n\r\nRecommend this place to anyone.\r\n\r\nThanks so much, Linda!\r\nH &L. xx</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Min man och jag bodde fyra nätter hemma hos Ami & Jonny och vi kände oss direkt mycket välkomna. In- och utcheckning var mycket smidig och vi fick svar direkt vid alla kontakter. Både rummet och det egna näraliggande badrummet kändes rymligt och trevligt och även köket hade vi mer eller mindre för oss själva. Lägenheten var lugn och fridfull för att ligga så centralt. Läget var helt perfekt med tunnelbanan på andra sidan gatan och Gamla stan mm inom promenadavstånd. Gott om trevliga restauranger, kaféer och pubar i närområdet. Ami var mycket angelägen om att vi skulle trivas och vi fick flera bra tips, bl a puben Akkurat med levande musik på söndagkvällar och en vidunderlig utsikt över hela Stockholm från berget strax bredvid. Allt detta bidrog till att vår Stockholmsvistelse blev väldigt lyckad och vi kommer gärna tillbaka en annan gång!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Big room and comfortable bad. clean bathroom. Breakfast with biscuits, fresh fruit, selection of tea, bread butter jam...the apt is Right in front of the subway station, 10min walking or 2 subway stops from gamla stra (the historical center). High floor with elevator, silent neighborhood. Restaurants and supermarkets around the corner. absolutely suggested.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Takk for en fin uke i din flotte leilighet! Den var praktisk for 4 voksne i hvert sitt soverom, og fungerte supert med to bad når alle skulle være klare til samme tid om morgenen. Vi deltok på kurs alle dagene, og skulle gjerne tilbrakt mer tid i leiligheten. Sentral beliggenhet var et pluss, og vi fikk tips av Thomas om spisesteder. Overlevering av nøkler fungerte helt utmerket, og vi følte oss velkommen og godt i varetatt. Her bor vi gjerne igjen!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ulrike's Place is just a hop, skip, and a jump, from the Metro Station.  It is outside of town center and surrounded by wonderful nature, yet you can get on the Metro and be in the city in 20 minutes.  Ulrike will offer to pick you up, and that is probably best if you have luggage, however if you like the experience and exercise, it's not too bad --must be able to do steps.  Ulrike has a great kitchen and washroom and the room is clean, and comfortable, and inviting for two.   She has H2O in the room, which is nice and there is a comfortable breeze that comes into the room through the window.   Ulrike provided us with coffee and breakfast-which is rare in the AirB&B space.  She provided us with local tips, walking trails and swimming locations, as well as places in Stockholm to visit.  Ulrike definitely is a Super Host and a kind and generous person!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ulrike was as good as they come when it comes to a host. Her place is about a 5 min walk to the train station. She was very flexible with my check-in and check-out times. She was more than accommodating during my stay. Had breakfast every morning for you should you decide to partake. I definitely helped myself to some toast with fresh spreads, fresh fruit, and hot tea! It can be quite expensive in Stockholm, so the free breakfast was greatly appreciated. She also gave me some great suggestions of places to check out while I was there. The room I had was very spacious and had plenty of closet/drawer space to put your things away. Large windows for a nice breeze. The listing shows 1.5 baths but I was only shown one bathroom, however that one bathroom was more than sufficient. I would definitely considering staying here again in the future!\n\nJust FYI her place is a bit of climb. Wasn't too bad for me, but I can see how some might have some trouble. Though, I'm sure if you needed help with that, Ulrike would be more than willing to set something up. Just need to ask :)\n\nLastly, and this wasn't a big deal for me, but I wasn't aware that there would be another guest during my stay. They had their own room so it's not like we shared sleeping quarters and privacy was more than adequate. It was just a bit of a surprise. I can see how some others might not take it so well. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Stockholm. Getting a feel for the transit system really helps you experience the day to day culture of the area, in my opinion!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>F contacted us in advance and when we arrived was able to give us directions.  These were essential, as Airbnb had given us the wrong address (even the wrong street)!  The area was edge of Sodermalm; not central, but peaceful.  The apartment was sunny, well equipped  and clean.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Tina is a energetic wonderful lady and a pleasure to be dealing with.We were dropped off at the wrong address and she walked up and helped us with the heavy luggage too.Very receptive and helpful.House is peculiarly located up some steps one side and a steep one small road the other but well located and equipped.Was very hot the days we stayed  but everything is clpose by and we just cycled around.Its a stylish nice place and very comfortable.Fridge is stocked with the things one might require and Tina is a very thoughtful host and does take care of her guests well.But again there is one problem with all AirBnb accomodations:-- the hosts fill up all available spaces/cupboards and you will have to live out of your suitcases.We, with our 4 year old daughter were one a 3 weeks vacation so  the amount of luggage was quite a lot .Even then it is highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Stockholm is a great city and the house is located in a lovely, leafy quiet suburb and is a 10-15 minute subway ride into the centre and is a unique 60s showpiece. There is nothing wrong with the property or location unfortunately we were just very let down by the host for this villa on the first night of a special occasion. A big group us planned a surprise trip for my sisters 40th birthday, unfortunately had our first day and arrival dampened as we were locked out with no help. Our host didn't respond to any of my messages that day so I wasn't sure what was happening for check in. I wasn't too worried as he is a super host and so I was under the impression he was meeting us as he didn't supply any additional details or provide any communication at all that day or the day before for check in at 4pm. We arrived to the house in the rain and thunder and no one was there to meet us and the front door was locked. I tried calling and messaging the host many times with no response at all. It had a coded door so we read the manual on the website and hoped he set the code according to the manual - nothing was set. We were stuck out in the suburbs with our luggage in the rain on a Friday, not an ideal start to a surprise birthday weekend break. Two of our party were pregnant and highly uncomfortable, so I felt awful for them as it is the suburbs there was no where for them to go and sit to wait or use the loo while we sorted out the problem. I called air bnb once I realised we weren't going to hear from our host and they were helpful, my contact was lovely and sympathetic. They were trying to contact the host too with no luck. We tried all the doors and found a side door which luckily wasn't locked and got in the house. We felt a bit uncomfortable going into the house via an unlocked side door but were reassured this was ok by the air bnb help desk. We had to leave our luggage in the house unsecured and unlocked as we had a birthday dinner planned in the city and we didn't want to stay in. We ended up missing our dinner reservations for my sister's birthday party which was disappointing, so we ended up walking around until we found somewhere that would take a big group at that time on a Friday night. We didn't hear from the host until 9pm, which is 5 hours from check in and we finally got a code for the locked front door that we could use the rest of the weekend. Really disappointing service from a super host and not ideal when you only have a short weekend in the city. Otherwise it was a lovely city and...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>En veldig stilig leilighet med god plassering i Stockholm. Litt upraktisk for en familie med tre barn da det var lite skapplass og ble tidlig lyst der barna sov (på stua). Ellers en fin og lys leilighet med hyggelig, liten terrasse og et spisebord perfekt for mange personer. Kort vei til buss og t-bane og hyggelig nærmiljø. Bare en liten rusletur til fin badeplass på Långholmen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jeg likte at hun er en varm og utadvendt person som gjerne hjelper til med at du skal få et flott opphold. Men at det er privat og alltid ledig på badet. Flott veibeskrivelse så tok meg dit  første gang uten vansker. Rent og ordentlig. Fin balkong. Trygt sted og bo som du lett tar deg til fra sentrum til alle døgnets tider. Anbefales på det varmeste og jeg skal tilbake dit. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I've never given a bad review and I hate leaving one now... having said that - Christopher's place was a disappointment. I'm still surprised at how many things can go wrong in such a small apartment. Here is a quick list of things I encountered:\n\n1. Main light doesn't work\n2. Shower head stand is broken\n3. Garbage door doesn't close all the way. This is a problem because it's a small apartment so you will smell the garbage immediately.\n4. The floor wasn't swept when I got there.\n5. The towels were dirty\n6. Some dishes were dirty\n7. The host's friend was late to check-in\n8. TV remote batteries were dead\n9. Probably the worst (and smelliest) pillow I've ever used.\n\nAs a bonus the internet died while I was there (the switch was old and just stopped working) and Christopher told me to call the internet company and talk to them... I don't speak Swedish. Thankfully it wasn't a big deal since I could tether through my phone.\n\nThis airbnb is passable if you are staying for 1-2 days. I do not recommend anything longer than that.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Τeresa was a nice hostess and provided me with everything I needed to have a comfortable stay. A few things went wrong but it wasn't her fault I think, mostly bad luck. I would recommend  the place to anyone as it is near to public transport</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at Per's  studio from Sept. 7th to Sept 10th.  It is as described and extremely well located.  As a female travelling alone, one is always concerned with the location of where we're residing,  but there are no concerns here.  I often arrived late at night and never felt any danger.  But Stockholm in general is very safe.  The studio is located close to the subway as well as to various buses.  It is also walking distance from Djurgarden island and I walked from the studio to the Vasa museum.  Great location.  Also there is an amazing bakery not far from the apartment on Valhallavegen street between the subway & the apartment (don't remember the name) but the breads, croissants, etc are amazing.  I went there for breakfast a couple of times and I loved it.\nPer also made sure that I had access to certain amenities  (e.g. shampoo - I forgot mine at the last place I stayed so thank you Per).  There's tea, coffee & snacks that are greatly appreciated.\nThe bed is reasonably comfortable but if someone has a bad back  (like I do) then perhaps a firmer mattress would be warranted.  Other than that,  the studio is great.  I never meet Per but he always answered promptly to any of my requests.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jeg havde et perfekt ophold. Forholdene er ideelle, værelset og badeværelset har god plads til en. Der er hvad man skal bruge. Jeg følte mig hjemme og meget velkommen. Per svarer meget hurtigt. Ved mit næste besøg i Stockholm håber jeg bestemt at kunne bo der igen. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice studio, really quiet. Perfect to enjoy Stockholm\nToo bad we couldn't meet Per, butbhe leaved us many informations about the place. I definitely recommand him</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The studio is small but very nice. The host was very responsive and helful with everything we needed. A negative point is that it's not possible to cook anything in the studio but the host left some snacks for our late arrival and that was really nice. The neighbourhood is friendly but if you're planning on going around everywhere by foot with a bad weather, I must say that it's not that close to the main center. However, we enjoyed our stay very much and we recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin lägenhet med perfekt läge för den som vill strosa runt på söders gator. Bekväm säng med två täcken och tre kuddar. Uppskattas! Eve var en jättebra värd som svarade snabbt på våra frågor. Det som drar ner betyget något är att vi upplevde lägenheten som ”slarvigt” städad, framför allt badrummet hade behövt en rejäl skrubbning. I övrigt kan jag rekommendera detta boende.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag har bara lovord att säga om såväl Isabellas bemötande som lägenheten. Isabella fick mig verkligen att känna mig välkommen i hennes hem och svarade snabbt och trevligt på mina frågor via mess. Lägenheten ligger i ett lugnt område med några minuters avstånd till en välsorterad mataffär och någon minuts avstånd till en busshållplats. För mig som ville handla lite så var läget suveränt iom att Drottninggatan låg så nära också. Lägenheten var ren och fräsch och en extra bonus var att det fanns badkar att krypa ner i efter en lång dags promenerande. Jag kan starkt rekommendera Isabella som värd och hyr gärna lägenheten igen, nästa gång jag ska till Stockholm. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I think we must have caught Isabella on a bad week, because all of her reviews seem great. Sadly, we didn't have the best stay at her place and we would have looked for another place to stay if money weren't an issue. While her place is a fine size (there were three of us) and it IS centrally located with GREAT views, there were just some things that really dampened our stay. \n\nFirst and foremost, the place was covered in dust, and like a layer of dust. Everything, even the top of the couch cushions, was covered in dust. I'm allergic to dust so I actually got sick for my entire trip because of it. I was confused at first and thought I was just getting a cold and then I realized my symptoms would lesson when I was out of the house and so I looked closer at the apartment the second day and realized all of the dust. It really sucked. The other big thing was there was an odor in the kitchen that bothered all three of us. It smelled like sewer. Thankfully it was only in the kitchen or we would have had to find another place. But we had rented her apartment for the kitchen so that we could cook and save money. Sadly that was not an option. No one likes to cook and eat their food if the kitchen smells like a dirty bathroom. These two things could have possibly occurred if no one had used the apartment for months. \n\nWe also had communication issues. Before arriving to Sweden and the day we arrived Isabella was AMAZING at communicating with us through airbnb. She would always respond within the hour. Her fiance even picked us up from the airport and she helped us find him when we got lost. They were both very kind and helpful. After we said goodbye to her fiance the communication broke down. There were three of us and she only gave us one set of keys. When we asked for a second set of keys, it took her a full day to respond and another full day to get us the keys. So we had an extra set for our last full day. Sadly it wasn't that helpful. We didn't have international phone plans so I could only talk through email/airbnb so maybe she would have been more responsive through text. \n\nThere were other little things around the apartment that were annoying. The button on the toilet to flush was broken and it actually snapped off my friend's nail. And there were issues with the shower head. But those weren't the worst things. \n\nIf you don't think the above things would bother you, then go for it. Her place IS perfectly located in the city!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Good flat. Conveniently located, transport, shops, cafes, all in walking distance. The apartment has everything for a comfortable stay. It’s bad that the reconstruction of the neighboring house is near and the builders start working too early, they don’t let them sleep. Nevertheless, the apartment is beautiful and I definitely advise everyone to take advantage of the hospitality of the hostess Isabella.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The location of this place is great.  Walk from Central Station. Walk to most of the city centre.  Plus lots of public transport options.  It is small, and it is hot, and there is a building site across the road. Communication was unfortunately not clear.  Luckily I was met there by Isabella’s father as the key instructions I had been given were wrong.  Then I was given some further wrong information.  However I did access it ok during my stay.  TV did not work and no one could really help me.  Luckily I had asked for information about access to the laundry, but that was also incorrect.  There is no information in the apartment about how things work.  It was a convenient but not entirely relaxed stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is nice and clean with a perfect location in the heart of Sodermalm, just 5 min to metro and 15 to Gamla Stan .   The bad is compfy and the place is bright. Tara is very friendly. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tara var mycket vänlig och tillmötesgående. Läget är mycket bra, det finns många trevliga restauranger och fina promenadvägar i närheten.  Lägenheten är ljus, ren och trivsam, och badrummet är rymligt och bekvämt. Man måste ändå vara på det klara med att lägenheten är liten och att kokmöjligheterna är små.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I can't recommend Tara's place enough. Perfect for a couple, or solo traveler, the space is cozy, and in the best part of town. Trust me, when I say, it's close to everything that is cool about Stockholm. The bed is extremely comfortable, the shower has amazing water pressure, and the bathroom floors are heated! It's all so charming, and easily accessible. We only met Tara once, but she was so friendly and gave us some useful tips. You can't go wrong staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice room with a stylish bathroom, small fridge, microwave oven, tea, cookies,  paper plates and spoons (though there are no knife and forks, there is a corkscrew :) ). \nApartments are very good located in the hipster part of town - Södermalm. There are cafes, supermarkets, pharmacy and subway nearby. It's a quiet and calm district 20 minutes walking from the old town and 30 minutes to city center.\nTara is very nice and responsive. It was very easy to find the place and get in. She also provided suggestions where to go and what to visit.\nAt the same time, there were a couple of inconveniences, that didn't allow me to put a perfect rate. \nFirst of all, there was some troubles with a vent, that is just above the bed. It is very noisy and interferes with sleep. Think it should be repaired, cause in the bathroom the same vent doing well. The ventilating lattice also should be cleaned, cause there are a lot of dust collected due to air flow, and the picture beyond the vent is full of powder. And all of these just above the bed.\nThe second problem was with the internet. I hardly managed to connect my iPhone after hour of trying (though Tara was very willing to help). After all, she disconnected a couple of her devices from the router, and I managed to connect. But still, it didn't help with a connection of my iPad, neither my wife's iPhone. But who needs the internet in the XXI century?) (Ha-ha, it's time for bad jokes). \nThe third problem was a broken hairdryer. But it's the smallest one of difficulties, Tara just didn't know about it. I think someone from previous guests was not an honest person)\nThat's all. I liked the place and the host. After repairing troubles I think it would be a very comfortable place to stay in a beautiful North Venice - Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Man skal ikke forvente en lejlighed, som der står i opslaget, men et godt værelse med egen indgang.\nDer er et rigtig fint badeværelse.\nVi vidste, at der ikke var køkken, men vi vidste ikke, at man skulle vaske op i en meget lille håndvask på badeværelset uden opvaskemiddel og opvaskebørste.\nDer findes et absolut minimum, to kagetallerkener, to teskeer, to knive, to krus og to glas.\nDer findes ingen kaffemaskine, som der står.\nStolene til spisebordet er to umagelige træklapstole.\nSengen er suveræn god.\nBeliggenheden perfekt.\nEt godt sted at bo nogle dage, men der skal lige rettes op på et par ting.\nTara er sød og hjælpsom.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Det var præcis som forventet.

Møtte aldri Kristina, men hun var rask til å svare på spørsmål vi sendte på mail, både før og underveis av oppholdet :) - at vaskemaskinen var ødelagt var et minus, vi hadde planlagt å vaske i ferien - syns kanskje airbnbs rengjørings \"\"gebyr\"\" på dette huset var veldig høyt (hvem bestemmer egentlig det?!)

Mijn verzoek kwam wat last-minute, maar desondanks zette Elsa alles in gang om voor mij een verblijf mogelijk te maken. \r\n\r\nHet appartement was een stuk groter dan ik dacht. Het heeft een grote woonkeuken, een overloop naar het slaapgedeelte en de badkamer. Het bed is super comfortabel. \r\n\r\nHet appartement is met veel zorg en aandacht ingericht, met knusse spulletjes. En het is waar dat het appartement een goeie vibe heeft, je voelt je meteen thuis. Soms hoor je wel de bovenburen maar dat is niet anders met hotels in oude gebouwen. \r\n\r\nIk was er tussen kerst en oud en nieuw en vond de wijk SOFO lekker rustig en zag weinig verkeer. Veel design en art en vintage winkeltjes en meer dan genoeg koffie tentjes en supermarkt gelegenheden. Ideale combinatie om te slenteren maar ook een metro in de buurt. \r\n\r\nElsa is een ideale host, heel genereus, betrokken en openminded. Dankzij haar flexibiliteit was mijn verblijf in Stockholm perfect. Een aanrader.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Therese provided the best service you can imagine!

Amazing flat and room, the picture doesn't do it justice really, high ceilings, bright and spacious, comfy bed and pillows. Dick is very nice and friendly, good communication. The only issue was the noise from the street at night, but slept nonetheless so can't have been that bad!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Værelset var dejlig stort, lyst og vestvendt med fuld eftermiddagssol. God seng og stort skrive- og fralægningsbord. Plads til tøjet. Både her, på badeværelse og i køkkenet var meget rent og ordentlig. Både værten og hans søn var stille og rolige mennesker, der tog godt imod mig, så jeg følte mig godt tilpas. Deres Bolig på 3.sal (elevator) har en meget central beliggenhed med T-banestation og 4-5 buslinjer næsten udenfor gadedøren.

Vädret var under denna månad perfekt så vi spenderade en stor del utomhus på altanen i kvällssolen där grillen ofta var igång. Krister är supertrevlig och hjälpsam i alla tillfällen. En supergranne helt enkelt!\nEtt par minuters promenad till sjön med badplats och restaurang och lika få minuter till naturreservat med elljusspår.  \n\nKan starkt rekommendera detta för någon som precis som jag vill känna på lite hur det är att leva livet i ett lugnt villaområde strax utanför storstan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bra sovplats. Nära till bad. Nära till buss.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My stay at Mona's was first first time using Airbnb, and I really lucked out! It was such a great experience! Mona was so friendly and welcoming, and despite what her profile says, she speaks LOTS of English! We shared a chat and a glass of wine a couple of nights, and she has the cutest little dog! The room was spacious, clean and well-lit and the location is within walking distance of everything you'll want to see/do in Stockholm, yet secluded enough that you don't have to worry about noise and it feels very safe. Lots of restaurants and shopping very close by! You can't go wrong by staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jeg ankom Stockholm sent på kvelden - langt utenfor normal innsjekkingstid, men Monas sønn tok i mot meg og viste meg tilrette.  Rommet var stort og luftig, og bad, toalett og kjøkken var like ved.  Strøket var stille og rolig og kurset jeg skulle delta på hotellet rett nedi bakken. Kirke med park like ved der man kunne nyte solen.  Både Mona og hennes sønn var veldig imøtekommende og hjelpsom! Kan absolutt anbefale stedet og kommer gjerne tilbake :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my first AirBnB experience and also my first time in Scandinavia and wasn't quite sure what to expect sharing a place with the host, but it couldn't have better.  Mona's communication was excellent and her apartment is in a great location (not a bad walk from Central Station upon arrival) and in a quiet neighborhood.    Spacious room and Mona was a wonderful host.  Highly Recommend!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gunilla var en perfekt vert! Leiligheten var helt nydelig og perfekt plassert og Gunilla hadde lagt fram håndkler og badekåper og tøfler som vi kunne bruke. Beliggenheten på sødermalm var perfekt for oss, nærme alt og i en kul bydel. Anbefaler alle å bo her!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I can highly recommend Isabela as a host. \nThe place is sweet and within walking distance to public transport and easy access to Stockholm. \nEasy parking, 150,- SEK for 24 hours which isn't too bad for Stockholm </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The apartment was totally serviceable, but I wish they had posted photos of the actual apartment we were staying in, rather than their general stock photos. For the price, I would have expected better amenities (no tea or coffee) and a higher standard of comfort (the 'double' bed was just two singles pushed together, so we kept rolling into the gap between them. This also led us to discover that the mattress pads are not cleaned between guests). It's not a bad place to stay-- the location is amazing apart from the strange entrance and lots of stairs-- but a bit too expensive for what they are offering. Also the \"\"luggage room\"\" is just the electrical closet. The small space available for guests to leave luggage was already completely full when we checked out.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location was excellent, just crossing a bridge from Gamla Stan and a block from metro station. Another good point is the staff: quick answers, check in instructions very clear and easy and the lady that works there was very friendly. \nWe were travelling with a baby and they've provide us a bassinet that helped a lot! Thank Second Home Appartments for that! The bathroom was very good, spacious too. \nThe appartment however, is more a hotel flat than an appartment. It was well equiped but the kitchen was small. No dishwasher and the coffe machine was big for two people (my suggestion is to provide a Nespresso Machine so it would be easier prepare breakfast). As we had to cook for the baby it was a little problem.   \nThe matrimonial bed is actually two beds put together, so it is good for a couple but bad for one single person.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Her ble vi ønsket velkommen med champagne og fin eplemost til ungene! Helt super leilighet for oss med tre barn, stue og soverom hadde god plass, kanskje litt liten plass på badet. Det vi trengte av kopper og kar fant vi på kjøkkenet. Lett å komme seg inn til sentrum og gamlebyen. Nærområdet var veldig barnevennlig med flott lekeplass og badeplass for ungene. Herlige svaberg for de som er litt større.\r\nAnbefales :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lägenheten var lätt att hitta och bara en kort promenad från busshållplatsen. Inte långt från tunnelbanan heller. Lägenheten var rymlig och mysig. Fräscht badrum och kök. Sommarhalvåret är det säkert härligt att sitta på balkongen med en kaffekopp i handen. Vi hade härliga dagar på Söder och kommer gärna åter!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Decent flat in a nice location with a great balcony. Unfortunately we got off to a bad start due to our late arrival causing a very long and expensive cab fare.$70 USD to pick up the key. Advise arriving when host can meet you at the flat. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi har haft 5 rigtig dejlige dage i Johan og Thereses hus. Gåafstand til skov og vand med bademuligheder. \nBoligen har smuk udsigt over Mälaren, og den har alt hvad vores familie på 5 + 2 bedsteforældre behøver. Alt var pænt og rent. Dejlig overraskelse med vin til de voksne og sodavand i flere slags til børnene.\nJohan svarede med det samme på hvad vi havde af spørgsmål. \nVi kørte til Stockholm i egen bil, fandt nemt parkering. Her var vi på kanalrundfart (2t), shoppede i Östermalm og gik turer i Gamla Stad. Vi var på Skansen og også en tur på Vasamuseet. Den sidste dag kørte vi til Vaxholm og sejlede med gratis færger, som forbandt et par skærgaardsøer og kørte den vej mod Stockholm igen. \nVil helt klart anbefale denne bolig. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Meget dejlig lejlighed. God beliggenhed tæt på undergrunden og i et rart område. Rummelig, pænt og personligt indrettet, skøn balkon, veludstyret køkken, gode badefaciliteter, hyggelig stue.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jättefin fräsch liten lägenhet med superfint badrum med bastu. Värdparet var jättetrevliga och tillmötesgående och läget i Stockholm är perfekt. Allt kontakt innan var snabb och utan problem. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very bad! They were very rude! The place smelled like weed and the host was making soooo much noise we were honestly so scared and would never recomend this! They were aggressive and seemd racist</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een echte aanrader als je Stockholm wilt bezoeken! Dicht bij een metro station en erg rustig gelegen met een supermarkt dichtbij. De kamer is super groot en heeft een zithoek en eettafel erbij. Ook kun je gebruik maken van de kitchenette en badkamer (gedeeld samen met 1 andere kamer) Kerstin is een lieve vrouw die je gelijk thuis laat voelen daar!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastisk ophold! Kerstin og Lars er sådan nogle dejlige mennesker. De fik os til at føle os hjemme i Stockholm. Værelset er stort og lyst. Man deler evt køkken og bad med er andet hold gæster - hvilket i vores tilfælde kun tilføjede positivt til oplevelsen. Alt er rent og pænt! Vi gjorde rigtig god brug af den dejlige have man frit kan benytte. \n\nIdeel location: 20 min til central Stockholm men samtidig kun 10 min gang til det mest naturskønne område ved vandet! Et besøg til den gamle dynamit fabrik kan varmt anbefales - 40 min gang langs vandet hvor man passerer kolonihaver, får, badebro og klipper hvor folk ligger og solbader. \n\nVil helt klart bo her igen næste gang turen går til Stockholm! \n\nTak!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maria and her family and their beautiful lake front house made my first trip to Sweden so fantastic, I have told everyone I want to move there. \nThe property is on the lake. Cozy, clean and lovely. But the truly fantastic add on is the hospitality. Maria and her family took care of all my needs from kayaking (including life jacket et. al), breakfast based on what I like and directions to what to see and where to go.\nI enjoy spending time on my own on holidays and this place, even though on their property, allowed me that privacy whilst at the same time they were always there should I need help.\nIt is slightly outside of the city centre which can seem daunting. I was there for a work conference and stayed for the weekend. You have to take a short bus ride but (and I am notorious at being bad with directions) after the first journey I was a pro. Plus there is the lovely restaurant next door.\nIf you want a relaxing holiday, with a wonderful lake front view, all the adventure amenities, close trip to city centre and superb hospitality from the friendly hosts, then this IS THE place to stay in Sweden. \nLooking forward to going again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een fantastische plek om te verblijven als je Stockholm wilt verkennen! Zeker als je de rust en natuur waardeert; na een dag in de stad, ben je binnen 25 min met trein en bus bij Maria en Per. Waar je in een heel schattig houten boothuis verblijft in hun tuin, direct aan een meertje gelegen. Ontbijten op de steiger met je voeten in het water behoort tot de opties! Hun huis ligt net wat hoger en daar bevindt zich ook de badkamer + toilet. Ze hebben in hun kelder (wat bg is) een prima, nette, ruime badkamer aangelegd. Maar het meest bijzonder zijn zij zelf. Ik heb Per niet veel gezien tijdens mijn korte verblijf, maar Maria heeft mij zo warm en welkom ontvangen, zelfs opgehaald en op zondagochtend 6.30 uur erop gestaan mij naar het station te brengen voor mijn terugreis. Lieve, rustige, hele zorgzame gastvrouw- en heer bij wie je je direct thuis voelt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Maria en Per zijn zeer vriendelijke mensen. Het boothuis dat ze verhuren staat in hun tuin grenzend aan een meertje in het zuiden van Stockholm. Je hebt de beschikking over een eigen badkamer in het souterrain van hun woonhuis. Maria zorgt elke ochtend voor een heerlijke ontbijt mand. Op loopafstand is een supermarkt en een Thais (afhaal) restaurant. Met het openbaar vervoer ben je in ongeveer 30 min. in het centrum van de stad. Het was heerlijk om na een dag in de prachtige maar drukke stad terug te komen op deze rustige plek in de natuur. Het weer was geweldig en we hebben een fantastische week gehad, mede dankzij Maria & Per's grote gastvrijheid.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bei maria und per war es super, tolle unterkunft. Wir konnten den ganzen garten, badeplatz und ihr zweier kanu mitbenutzen. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Die Anreise war durch detaillierte Angaben von Kerstin leicht , die Begrüssung herzlich. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber, stilvoll und ruhig. In einer kleinen kitchenette stand Tee und Kaffee zum selbermachen bereit. Den Garten konnten wir dank gutem Wetter mitbenutzen und dort zu abend essen. Die Nachbarschaft ist erlaufenswert, in der Nähe konnten wir sogar in den Schären baden gehen. Die Metro ist 5min entfernt. Ein kleiner supermarkt hat alles was man braucht. Kerstin hat die wichtigsten Tips für Stockholm und das Quartier zusammengefasst für ihre Gäste, und wir haben uns gerne daran orientiert. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een rustige locatie net buiten het centrum. Prima te bereizen met de metro die op zo'n 5 minuten lopen een halte heeft. Ruime kamer en schoon gehouden keukentje en badkamer. Er lagen tips en een map klaar voor ideeën. Gastvrijheid is uitstekend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Liten kokplatta. Tråkigt att behlva dela badrum med andra.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Siwa is a kind lady with a very nice place and plenty of knowledge about Stockholm and places you should visi, as well as generally being very hospitable. I might also add that location is beautiful, and that the bed is a god-send for tired souls. You can't possibly go wrong with her, especially when you wake up to breakfast and coffee. My first AirBnB experience, and it was simply great. Thank you, Siwa!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great location, great host, and great space. You really can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>After reading many positive reviews, I was dismayed that my own experience with Siwa ended up the opposite of so many people. Siwa felt controlling about my whole experience, well beyond her rules and role as the host, and repeatedly made negative, unnecessary, and unprofessional comments to me. From day 1, I felt like Siwa had a bone to pick with me, as she repeatedly questioned why I was in Stockholm to begin with and why I even bothered to come. She made several mean comments regarding any of the choices of the activities I was doing. Quite frankly, it’s my vacation, my money, and my time. None of that relates to the Airbnb experience and it is unmistakably not her place to judge what I’m choosing to do on my vacation. I felt like she was actively trying to make me believe my experience was miserable and that I was wasting it, which made me feel horrible every time we had a conversation, like I wasn’t doing enough. To hear comments like that from the host is just downright unprofessional, rude, and uncomfortable to the guest. \nThere were numerous incidents were Siwa was unnecessarily rude and mean to me. Asking to double check how the shower worked was met with scoffs, and calling me stupid and responding with “Don’t they have showers in America!?”. She never shied away from telling me I had no brain power. She never seemed to get over that I had problems with unlocking the door that one time. She repeatedly brought up my failure with the lock to humiliate me for my mistake several times after the incident, questioning how I could lack the brain power. She questioned why I walked everywhere instead of taking public transport. She reprimanded me for not having a fully developed Airbnb profile while boasting about the profile of the next guest after me, as if to say “you’re not good enough”.  She repeatedly thought the jackets I used were inadequate and chastised me for wearing a Columbia Sportswear winter coat, despite the fact it worked perfectly fine for me. She told me I was just flat out wrong, and could not fathom that the jacket I was using was actually fine and has worked for me for years. There was nothing I could that was right in her mind. Most egregiously, she crossed the line when she attacked me and accused me of having no friends and not having any social life back home, because she thought my habits were not normal. There’s a difference between making constructive suggestions versus personally attacking someone and saying they have no friends and no social life. That crossed the line and brought me to tears. The jabs seemed to continue even on the way out, as I had previously explained that I was a history major and she mentioned historians not making any money as I walked out of the apartment.\n\tThe apartment had a great location at least, and it was nice of Siwa to offer food.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"My gf and I were two nights in Stockholm. Juli was a nice person and reacted to our messages quickly. Also we were allowed to use her kitchen. Thanks, Juli! \r\nBUT she should change the pictures. We felt like in the wrong place, because it looks completely different now! She loves Mozart - so she changed the whole furniture to baroque style (red velvet chairs and a tiny sofa). So the pictures show a total different furnished apartment. Also it would be nice to have a curtain in the door case by the bed since Juli uses the kitchen late in the evening and so there is neither real privacy nor darkness.\r\nThe area however is perfect for city visitors. There is a shopping mall in 5 min. walking distance and the train station in 2 min. which takes you straight to the \"\"Gamla Stan\"\" and Central station.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi trivdes jättebra i Susannes hus och närheten till Mässan var väldigt bra eftersom vi var där och jobbade under vistelsen. Vi fick även bra tips på restauranger och kommunikation mm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Susann var en flott vert, med et veldig koselig sted. Hun var åpen, imøtekommende og hjelpsom. Huset var stort og trivelig, og man mangler ingenting. Vi følte oss veldig hjemme. Stort og varmt bad, med alle fasiliteter. Spesielt stua med kjøkkenet er veldig koselig sone i huset. Merk at det ene soverommet ikke har egen inngang, men går gjennom et annet soverom. God gateparkering. Anbefaler!! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Aaron was terrible. His apartment was in a bad part of Stockholm, unless you like crappy malls and gas stations. I was late because of the train, but at 8:00pm Aaron was no where to be found. His instructions from the train were nonexistent, and when I got to his apt I needed a code that he never gave me. Repeated calls and texts no answer. I found a hostel and spent my vacation there. And of course no refund from Aaron. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great stay at Hampus' apartment in Hornstull and highly recommend!\nApartment:\n- very fast internet (we were both working and on video conference to the USA at the same time and it worked perfectly)\n- Apple TV with Netflix which is nice for bad weather nights\n- well equipped kitchen - Hampus lets you use whatever you need, which means no buying spices, etc. for a short stay\n- good water pressure & temperature in the shower\n- really nice light in the apartment\n- quiet, on the top floor\n- lift to the 5th floor, one flight of stairs up to access\nNeighborhood:\n- we loved Hornstull, tons of cute shops and places to eat\n- tunnelbana is a short 5-10 minute walk and there's a great, affordable grocery and alcohol store in the station which was really convenient (subway is pricey though)\n- easy to walk to all of Sodermalm\n- Langholmen Kayak is about a 10 minute walk for kayak rentals\n- Lasse i Parken is a great beer garden that's a 5 minute walk (only open in summer)\nHampus, the host:\n- Hampus is incredibly responsive (both before and during our stay)\n- when our plans changed he was really flexible with our check out time\n- incredibly easy check-in and had the apartment available to us at 8am when we landed from the states\n- gave us great recommendations for things to do on our trip - had a blast at Grinda in the archipelago based on his recommendation</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I have never been so happy to write a review for an AirBNB. This place was perfect for our needs. Great size for a small family of 3, all of the amenities we could need, EXCELLENT location- close to public transportation, great food, quaint walks, outstanding parks for children....couldn’t have asked for better! The place is so cozy, even when weather was bad we enjoyed ourselves lighting candles and making use of the smart tv and delicious takeout from nearby restaurants. The shower was hot with great pressure. The view was beautiful. Simply said, it was perfect. Hampus was a stellar host. Provided incredibly detailed, well organized and thoughtful list of recommendations and was quick to answer any inquiries from us. Without hesitation I would highly recommend this place and this neighborhood if you are heading to Stockholm. So glad we found this gem!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Communication isn't good between Cesar and us. I think he didn't  understand that we had nearly 9h of transport (car/fly/bus/metro). He would have prefered that we take a taxi in Stockholm. \nWhen we arrived, there are already reproches. We refund 40€ for ease tensions. \nFlat is very clean but there are many bad smell in bathroom. \nCesar's messages concerning the cleaning of the appartment was repetitive and finally oppresive. \nWe didn't feel like home because of that and it was sad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cesar was really nice, and it was so easy for us to find the apartment with his guidance. The apartment is in a really nice neighborhood and everything was accessible thru the metro (T) in Stockholm. The rooms were clean and everything looked pretty good except for the really bad smell in the bathroom.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cesar was a great host! He was really easy to get in touch with and met us at the train station when we arrived. He walked us to the apartment and gave us lots of information and said not to hesitate to get in touch. The apartment was in a good location, close to the station and a big mall...and only about ten minutes from Stockholm centre. \r\n\r\nThe apartment itself was really bright and spacious, perfect for two people and with a pull out couch for more than two. And the main bed was to die! God bless a big comfy mattress that feels like a cloud. We slept so well every night. There is also a beautiful little balcony area overlooking Stockholm. \r\n\r\nThe only bad point was the bathroom. Although it was clean and fairly big, we can only assume there was is some sort of problem with the plumbing in the building as there was a truly awful smell. My friend has a weak stomach and couldn’t deal with it unfortunately - you can connect the dots here!\r\n\r\nBUT! That did not ruin our trip at all. We had a great time and are very thankful to Cesar. Stockholm is a beautiful city and we absolutely recommend it to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a great time in Cesar's flat: it is quiet, with a panoramic view on Stockholm with a good location (mall and metro station very close). Cesar was very kind and welcomed us at the bus stop to take us to the flat. The only problem was the bad smells in the bathroom.\r\n\r\nWe definitely recommend Cesar's flat!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het huis wordt door meerdere mensen gehuurd en de keuken en de badkamer moet je delen. Uffe doet wel erg zn best om het naar je zin te maken. Het ontbijt is goed geregeld.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Clean, modern, spacious, and charismatic flat right in the old town of Stockholm.  Just a short walk to many of the city's tourist sites.  It's a very old building, which is fun, but do expect to walk up some steep stairs. Also there is some light street noise if you are sleeping in the living room, but not bad considering it is in the center of the old city. Great host, good communications.  Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Katie's apartment was wonderful!! If you're looking for a centrally located, gorgeous flat in the most historic area of Stockholm, this place is for you!! It's beautifully decorated, the furniture is cozy, and so is the bed!\n\nWe loved being in the heart of Old Town and also enjoyed the proximity to the rest of the city. The place is right next to some *amazing* restaurants as well.\n\nKatia supplied everything we needed and made check in a breeze! \n\nYou can't go wrong</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tony was a great host who took care of us with information and special details like good coffee in the morning and medicines for my husband who had a bad cold! The room is spacious and clean, as well as the kitchen that you can use to prepare your meals or your breakfast.\r\nThe neighborhood is really nice. Even if it's not in the centre of Stockholm, it's only 20 minutes away to Gamla Stan or Stockholm Central by Underground. The walk from the house to the underground station takes only 1 minute, through a beautiful green park where the apartment is located.\r\nTony speaks english, swedish and italian, so it's also very recommended for italian travellers who don't speak english very well! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket trevlig lägenhet med alla bekvämligheter som kan önskas. Svårt att hitta ett bättre läge. Jag vill påstå att man behöver varken buss eller tunnelbana för att se hela Stockholm inklusive bada och sola. Rekommenderas starkt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice apartment in the calme and green area, clean comfortable bad. Get some difficult to check in. But after that my stay was comfortable and good. En général i recommande Caroline apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Huset til Jonas var om mulig enda bedre enn annonsen tydet på, og var perfekt til fire voksne og tre tenåringer. Det var gangavstand til både sjøbad, butikk og bar/kafe ved sjøen. Stockholm var tilgjengelig med både bil og trikk/T-bane. Drotningholm var like rundt hjørnet med bil, og mange andre muligheter som vi ikke rakk å benytte oss av. Poolen, som virket liten på bildene, var helt perfekt til tenåringslek og en dypp i varmen for de voksne. Kjøkkenet hadde alt, og sengene var gode, selv om rommet på loftet var litt rotete. Strøket var stille og rolig. Det eneste vi kunne ha ønsket oss var air condition, siden tropesommeren lå over Stockholm mens vi var der, men det er jo ikke normalen. Jeg har ingen problemer med å anbefale huset til Jonas for de som ønsker seg en romslig og behagelig base for å utforske Stockholm og omgivelser. Dessverre hadde konditoriet stengt akkurat den uken vi var der, så vi fikk ikke testet de prisvinnende croissantene.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was a short, but pleasant stay! Good bed, enough space and a cosy kitchen which you can use. Ture was very hospitable. Only thing is location, it's a pretty long walk to (for example) the central station. But that's a thing I read wrong and can be solved by using a travelcard for public transportation. Ture, thanks! Maybe we'll meet again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ture is a nice host!\r\nThe house is near the metro but it is quiet and comfortable, the room is so big that I can truly enjoy my stay in Stockholm.\r\nNo bad things at all! Would definitely come to Ture again if I go visit Stockholm again :)!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Pros: Location ok, the room was a good size.\r\n\r\nCons: The sheets were dirty on arrival (hair and other indications they had not been washed).  I asked the owner nicely if these could be changed (or laundered immediately) and he refused to address the issue. Further he became angry and shouted as I nicely tried to find a solution.  I ended up sleeping on a towel - which sounds uncomfortable, but the bed was actually worse.  It was saggy and very uncomfortable.  Most hosts are happy to provide local transit information - I was wondering about how to get to the airport from the metro line.  I was never able to get a clear answer and so I ended up going to the metro station and find out from a helpful attendant.  The directions to the apartment are complex - I asked the owner to email them to me because offline access has never worked well for me in the airbnb app - and email works great. He wouldn't take this step (despite more than one ask)  - which is very different from other hosts who usually accommodate the guest's preferred way to communicate and strive to make things simple.  Overall, I would not stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mkt trevligt hus, trevlig värd. No stress. 3 badrum.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is conveniently located, close to the metro station Skanstull. It is also nice that you can use the small kitchen and that there is a writing desk. However, never before have I slept in such an uncomfortable sofa bed. It's in a bad state with pits in it and the two parts of the bed are not at the same height so you cannot really comfortably sleep on it with 2 people. The supplies are also very limited (only 1 towel per person was provided for a stay of 7 nights!). Lastly, when we arrived we were told repeatedly not to mention to the other people in the building that we were renting the place through Airbnb. It seems to me that if you are not allowed or when it is not appreciated by the other people in your building to rent out your place, you just shouldn't do it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, nice sized appartment with one bedroom and two sofa's big enough to sleep on. Not really clean though. The appartment got real potential to be a top notch stay in Sodermalm, but the dust and filth bothered us when staying here. For example, there were some fruit and products in the fridge which had gone bad, causing a smell. Because of a carpet in the living room, dust seems to pile up, making it feel a bit stuffy. Hope this will be improved, than it really is a recommendation. Pezhman's communication is perfect, really helpful, making it easy to find the appartment and check in.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dear KurtPaul and Sennait,\r\nThank you so much for hosting me in your peaceful, immaculately clean, and tastefully designed apartment.  I enjoyed so much talking with you and with your very bright and friendly son.  Too bad I was not able to communicate with your well mannered, sweet, but shy guest.  All of you made my short stay in Stockholm that much more meaningful.  Thank you for helping me figure out my way back to the airport, Paul, your suggestion was much better than the clerk's at the ticket booth.  Both of you made me feel so welcome.  You are the ideal airbnb hosts.  Hope we meet again sometime.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Paul's home is a quintessential Swedish home and I had a most relaxing stay there.  The newly renovated apartment is cozy, clean and warm.  The open layout and the brightly lit atmosphere topped with the candle scent made me feel at ease.  The unit also came with a private bathroom for myself which gave me a sense of privacy.  The location of the unit is super central as it sits very close to the subway station.  There are plenty of food options nearby.  If you're into swimming like I am, the biggest swimming pool(Eriksdalsbadet) in Sweden is close by.\nCheck in/out at Paul's place was easy and Paul even came out to greet me near his home.  Most of all Paul and his companion are kind and generous people of Sweden and I am happy to have met them.  Paul, thank you again for opening your home to me.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jeg er takknemlig til Paul og Sanna for et trivelig opphold hos dem. I forkant av min reise til Stockholm var kommunikasjonen med Paul alltid rask og nøyaktig. Jeg ankom Stockholm tidlig på dagen og fikk lov til å sjekke inn tidlig. Paul ga meg gode tips om nærområdet både for opplevelser og matplasser. Jeg fikk også lov til å oppbevare mine ting i leiligheten etter utsjekk. Leiligheten var flott og lå vendt inn mot et rolig indre gårds området, og soverommet var større enn bildet viste. Jeg fikk til og med mitt eget bad. Flott vertskap som anbefales! \nTakk!\nHilsen fra Marina</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Paula & Sanna truly deserve the superhost recognition. The apartment is located in a very modern building, everything looks new and modern inside. The bed is amazing. The neighborhood where the apartment is at, in my opinion is the best part of town, you have cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and even some shopping centers. I actually only went once to the city center, most of the time i spend it in neighborhood. If you do decide to go to city center is an 18 min walk, which is not bad. In regards to the host they truly make you feel like part of their family. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Katia was fast with communication. At the beginning we had a problem with the wrong flat, but with the housekeeper and Katia we find fast the mistake and everything was ok.\r\nGood Point to start a nice holliday in Stockholm. Bus, Ship are around the house. Also to walk is no problem. \r\nThe flat is really beautiful and quit. \r\ngladly again </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi kände oss oerhört välkomna i denna super trevliga familj och deras fina hem.  Allt var i perfekt ordning, och riktigt familjevänligt, t.o.m. leksaker...och grannbarn... Uppskattades då vi hade en 3-åring o en 5-åring med oss.  Strålande trädgård med hängmatta och gränsande till liten allmänning, så perfekt lekplats.  Ligger fint nära nackareservat,badplats,Hellasgården och lekplatser. Man tar sig lätt till stan med tunnelbana och ev buss till tunnelbanan om man inte vill gå de 7 minuterna.  Rekommenderas VARMT!!\r\n\r\nWe felt incredible wellcome in this family and the nice, familyfriendly home.   Even equiped with toys, neighbour playmates for the kids and beautiful lush garden.  Situated close,walking distance, to nature reserve, little beach and playgrounds. The subway takes you fast to Stockholm c.   We can really recommend this unusually nice and friendly place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfekt boende för vår familj med två vuxna och två barn, 8 år och 10 år. Sköna sängar, rymligt kök och härlig uteplats med grill. Lätt att ta buss eller/och tunnelbana in till Stockholm. Det fanns cyklar att låna för att ta sig till närliggande badplatser. Härliga omgivningar för joggingtur och fint utegym i närheten. Väldigt trevlig värd som svarar snabbt om man undrar något.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Mycket trevlig lägenhet i hjärtat av Gamla Stan! Trevlig och tillmötesgående värd! Lägenheten fungerar väl för sex personer. Enda nackdelen är att det bara finns ett litet badrum - nog i underkant om man är åtta personer. Litet men välutrustat kök. Hög \"\"mysfaktor\"\"! Rent och snyggt! Kan rekommenderas!\"</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>A great home in the best location.  You can’t go wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Johans hus var alt, hvad vi drømte om. Beliggenheden er perfekt i forhold til by, metro, indkøb, restaurant/takeaway, sø til morgenbadning og gåtur i skoven. Huset ligger i et roligt og hyggeligt område  og er stort og smukt, både ude og inde. Vi var ni i alt - otte voksne og en 2årig, som alle nød haven, de to terrasser, de mange gode soverum, store og lækre badeværelser med sauna, rummelig og hyggelig stue og køkken-alrum med alt, der var brug for - og mere til - og ikke mindst mange legesager og plads til leg, tvhygge, lange måltider. Johan svarede lynhurtigt og meget hjælpsomt på vores henvendelser, og vi følte os derfor meget trygge og meget velkomne. Vi kommer meget gerne igen - og vi har stadig meget at opleve i Stockholm. På vores seks dage så vi og kan anbefale fotomuseet (ikke mindst for den smukke udsigt), Abba-museet (vi sang og dansede med de fire medlemmer), Skansen (kombineret Den gamle by/Zoo og Tivoli...og meget svensk!), Moderna Museet (gratis i den permanente afdeling). Vi købte et 7-dages kort til alle offentlige transportmidler, og det sparede os for mange penge. Transportsystemet fungerer upåklageligt, og vi kom hurtigt og nemt omkring. Spørg i informationen i lufthavnen - de guider i enhver detalje. Tag ikke lyntoget retur til lufthavnen, men benyt samme vej som ved ankomst  ind til byen, altså bus, regionaltog og metro - lyntoget betød et ekstra billettillæg på 120 kr. pr person, øv. Vi lærte, at kanelboller er godt, og at kardemommeboller måske er endnu bedre. Vores yndlings restaurant må være Hermans (god og billig vegetarbuffet). Vi fik den anbefalet ved at spørge en tilfældig mand på gaden. Tak for en skøn ferie, Johan og Stockholm☀️!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I’ve been at Nadia’s apartment for 10 days with my son (7 years old). We had a great, comfortable and pleasing stay. Nadia was very kind with us since the very moment I contacted her before the trip. She suggested some interesting and undoubtedly recommended visits and she was helpful about some general tips for the trip. We also shared interesting conversations and warm times during the stay. \nThe apartment is very well located, 20 min from Stockholm by metro (Red Line, 13, Norsborg direction). The metro station is just 5 min walk in a neighborhood area with supermarkets, grocery stores, pharmacy... We enjoyed the walk to the lake Mälarhöjdsbadet as well as the exciting and relaxing baths in the lake. There are several parks for children around the neighborhood and in the way to the lake. \nI definitely recommend Nadia’s place ;)\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ingen återkoppling från värden när problem uppstod .\nIskallt badrum.

Her var også en lun balkong og alle muligheten for å ha et trivelig opphold og et veldig fredelig boligområde Det var lett å finne fram, Pontus hadde gitt oss en oversiktelig beskrivelse. Leiligheten ligger sentralt i Stockholm. Absolutt å anbefale !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi har hatt fantastiske sommerdager i Stockholm! Isabelle sin leilighet var en super base, den er faktisk både større og finere enn hva vi trodde ut fra bildene! Badet er det minste rommet, men det har de fasiliteter som trengs, og for oss var det perfekt med et lite badekar hvor vår 1-åring fikk kose seg før leggetid. Et kvartal unna er det en park med gode muligheter for å slappe av og høre fuglene synge. Vi vil absolutt anbefale leiligheten til Isabelle!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ottima esperienza complessiva. L'appartamento è bello, meglio di come descritto. Molto luminoso, spazioso e perfetto per una coppia con una bimba di quattro anni. Cucina ben fornita. \nOttima posizione a due passi dalla metro. Di fronte c'è un playground con una piscinetta per bimbi, il posto ideale se si viaggia con un bimbo. Di fronte c'è anche  un bar tipicamente italiano (Cafè dello Sport), con pane e brioches squisite e un buon caffè espresso ad un prezzo molto ragionevole (15sek) per gli standard di Stoccolma.\nVicinissimo anche ad un altro grande parco che finisce in una spiaggia (Tanto strandbad) con anatre e minigolf a misura di bimbo.\nNon abbiamo incontrato André, ma abbiamo comunicato senza problemi.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house is really lovely and we felt at home! We shared it with Joel, Maria’s son, who is a very nice guy, pleasant to chat with, discreet and helpful. Perfectly located to visit Stockholm’s main spots, and the trendy neighborhood of Södermalm. Stunning view indeed over the city. Supermarkets, top restaurants, busses, metro, city bikes nearby.\nOnly demper: for who has a bad back, the bed’s mattress can be a bit soft. Everything else is just perfect! \n\nLa maison est un cocon plein de charme, on se sent vraiment comme chez soi. Joel, le fils de Maria avec lequel on partage l’endroit, est adorable et très discret. Parfaitement situé pour visiter les principaux spots de Stockholm, et le quartier très tendance de Södermalm. Vue incroyable sur la ville. Supérettes, bons restos, bus, métro, « Vélib » à proximité. Seul bémol: le lit peut être un peu mou pour les dos fragiles. Tout le reste est juste parfait!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"This was no ordinary visit, place, or host.  This was like coming home to a loving maternal figure who anticipates your needs, wants you to be happy, and is eager to do whatever she can to help make your stay special.  Maria is an authentic, caring, special woman, who is very funny, smart, and musically talented.  The home itself is fascinating--about 300 years old, rich with quirks and charms, and the bedroom for guests is perfect, with a large comfortable bed and an entire room, like a cozy studio, all to the guest.   The family is absolutely lovely, as I spent ample time talking with not only Maria but Maria's reflective, intelligent, and talented teenage son; the location is good, though I took cabs much of the time when I didn't feel like walking.  And it's not a bad walk from the house to Gamla Stan, the classic \"\"old town\"\"  that is one of Stockholm's many beautiful islands.  There are food spots and many stores within an easy walk from the house.  But it was the personal experiences</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fanny and her son live in a very nice area. in a 5 Minute walk you reach the ship to Skansen and can enjoy a very nice short trip to beautiful Stokholm. Everything was clean, the towels very soft and she made some space in the fridge for own food. While she was working, her lovely son stayed at home to help in any case.\r\nYou should be very open minded and like a simple lodging. The flat is a bit badly soundproofed, so you can hear the computergames, but it was to no time a problem for us. Fanny made everything to let us feel comfortable, gave us good tipps for fine restaurants and it was easy to communicate.\r\nThank you.\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Zara and Michael have been excellent hosts! My trip arrived late due to bad weather conditions and Zara was super responsive, accommodating my late arrival and very fast responsive to questions and/or messages. \nMy time was compressed with meetings in Stockholm but Zara was always sociable and warm welcoming whenever I came to the apartment which makes you feel home away from home. \n\nA super recommended place and I would consider it for my next trip for sure!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The Appartement is cool and its situation is not bad,in fact there are a supermarket and one renting bike stop close to it!\nHowever,the App was very very dirty,the microwave was plenty of food rests,the bed sheets weren't changed at all and there were hairs in the sink and in the shower.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi tilbragte fire dager i Hannas fine leilighet i Gröndal, og koste oss veldig. Stille og koselig nabolag, deilig å kunne spise frokost ute på altanen, komfortabel seng, rent og fresht bad og alt vi trengte. Vi fikk plass til reiseseng til baby inne på soverommet, og rullegardiner holdt den varme sola ute så det ble kjølig nok til natta de varme dagene vi var der! NB: Det er kun ett soverom, men om man behøver ekstra plass, kan noen sove på sofaen i stua.  \r\n\r\nDet var kort vei til trikk og buss til sentrum, en herlig lekepark med masse lekeapparater rett ved trikkestoppet, og nydelig gangsti langs vannet med fin utsikt. Vi åt både indisk og iransk mat vi kjøpte på Gröndal, og fant alt vi trengte av dagligvarer på Coop rett ved. \r\n\r\nVi kan på det varmeste anbefale å bo hos Hanna!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hannahs hjem ligger super godt med nem adgang til kollektiv trafik og city cykler. Det allerbedste er nærheden til vandet, hvor vi både morgen- og aftenbadede. Vi følte os hjemme så snart vi trådte ind ad døren. Har kun godt at sige om vores ophold og kommunikationen med Hanna var super fin. Vil vi vælge Hannahs hjem igen når vi skal til Stockholm igen. Lone og Sofie fra Danmark</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi bodde hos Thorbjörn och Alexandra i 3 nätter med våra tre barn- totalt 5 personer. Deras hem är mysigt och ombonat med mer smakfulla detaljer än geno (Hidden by Airbnb) ittet samt stort härligt badkar och exklusiv dubbelsäng. \nVi njöt av närheten till city men också av att kunna mysa i soffan med en film. \nVi skulle gärna återvända och rekommenderar det varmt till andra. \nMycket snabb och trevlig kontakt med Thorbjörn. \n/Kristina Rydbeck</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jan's apartment was absolutely lovely and the perfect place to stay for five days in Stockholm. The location is fantastic, super close to the metro and commuter rail and there are many restaurants and cafes nearby including the best coffeeshop in Stockholm, Drop Coffee (coming from a coffee snob!). The photos don't do justice to the flat itself, which is extremely spacious with a large living room, separate dining area, and good sized bedroom with closet space. The bathroom is also huge by Scandinavian standards, with a jacuzzi tub! It was very clean and comfortable, and Jan was extremely helpful in making sure we had everything we needed. He met us when we arrived (we had some trouble finding it initially -- beware that (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps will direct you to the wrong place!) and gave us great suggestions for exploring the neighborhood. We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Att bo hemma hos Anna var en upplevelse som representerar allt vi önskar av Airbnb. Personligt, vänligt, otvunget och gästfritt. Som att komma på besök hos någon man känt länge.\r\nFint rum, skön säng, stilla på gatan utanför, bra badrum och kök och ett levande hem i sin helhet. Anna såg till att vi hade allt vi behövde och mer utöver vad man kan förvänta.\r\nVi bor gärna där igen om vi åker till Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Anna is a great host! We love her home and the location of the stay. Anna is always home and able to ask questions, she loves answering them. For €5 each person she makes a great breakfast. \nWe had a good stay but were sleeping bad, the bed is really soft. But this is personal. We can recommend the stay at Anna her house. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very nice place and great host. Really big room, big tv, everything needed is there. Reynaldo shared his food with us, which was very kind from him.\nThe location is great, good infrastructure, silent and nice. The only bad is if you have an early flight from Skavsta airport, you may have experience some trouble with transport.\nGenerally a very nice place to stay, probably the best for that money. Great host. Fully recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Julias mom, Anne Marie, was really nice and patient with my bad Swedish :) Her apartment is nice and in a good area, away from the noise and with small parks around. My stay was short but I enjoyed very much.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>After traveling Europe for three weeks and having to put up with several bad accommodation, Irma's AirBnB listing has been an absolute Godsend. \n\nIrma and her two adorable dogs (Bibi and Lady) are warm, welcoming and gracious. The bed is comfortable and room is very clean, spacious and cosy, and it's located off the kitchen affording it some privacy.\n\nAn added bonus is the hearty breakfasts and conversations with Irma, whom is the epitome of Swedish hospitality. I can't elaborate anymore of how great my stay here was. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Highly recommended! :) it was very lovely room and quite comfortable! Great location and Irma was a nice host of course. even i couldn't talk with her much. almost just because of my bad english lol\nAnd her dogs were so lovely too ;)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket bra boende. Ligger nära till både affärer och T-station. När till både bad och grönområden. Trevlig värd som var lätt att prata med. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>1. prioritet for alle singel rejsende. Irma's værelse er det absolut bedste du kan få hvis du er på singelrejse, jeg kan kun anbefale alle at bo her,   5-10 min til stranden, badeområder og grønne steder, og 10 min til byens centrum. Der er pænt og rent, det er et lyst og dejligt værelse. Du har fred og ro. Irma hjælper med alt det du spørg om, som transport og  gode tips til alle slags seværdigheder. Morgenbord står klar til dig, der skal kun tændes for kaffemaskinen og tage smør, ost, pålæg og grønt fra køleskabet. Hav en god dag, Hanne Kold</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a joy to stay in Irma's AirBnB! The location is close to the airport bus and the metro, making it easy to access other parts of the city. If the weather is nice, like it was the October weekend I was there, the walk to other parts of the city is not bad either! There are many bars, restaurants, and shops nearby, as well as grocery stores. Irma gives several options for breakfast - a nice touch! The bed and the room, as a whole, are comfortable. If I am in Stockholm again, I will definitely re-book this room!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We were two couples staying at Susannas' apartment and we all enjoyed it. The foldout sofa is large enough for an adult couple. The kitchen is small but has all the basic stuff you need. The bus stop is only a few minutes away and it takes about 15minutes to T-Centralen. If you want you can walk to Djurgården. A subway station is also nearby. A ICA Nära is very close about 3 minutes by foot.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic we never met Susanna in person but check-in and check-out was easy. She responded quick over the AirBnB app so no issues with the communication.\n\nWifi in the apartment was reliable and fast.\n\nThe only bad thing for me was the small bed and blanket. With my 1,98m height I was too tall for both.\n\nWe all enjoyed the stay there and would stay there again. So we definitely recommend Susannas apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Da vi først kom til leiligheten ble vi møtt av Johannas vennlige vesen. Hun viste oss rundt leiligheten og ga oss tips til ting å gjøre i nærområdet. Nydelig leilighet med karakter og en behagelig, rolig atmosfære. Rent, plettfritt bad og kjøkken. I nærheten av mange gode restauranter og hyggelige steder i Södermalm. Anbefales på det varmeste.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really nice flat,excellent transport link to the centre,the tube station is literaly in front of the flat.Also supermarket is a stone’s throw.Malin and Jockes are super nice and helpful. Oliver, the dog is a real cuttie.The only bad thing is that when you are on holiday the time flies so fast, we really enjoyed our stay :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Leider sorgte der Aufenthalt in Elisabeths Wohnung für viele Irritationen. Wohl entspricht die Wohnung den Photos und liegt günstig. Andrerseits musste ich 20 MInuten in Regen und Kälte warten, bis mich die Hilfskraft erkannte und mich einliess. Keine Instruktion der Wohnung ausser dem knappen Handout.\nDusche funktionierte vorerst nicht (kein Wasser). Der Zufluss wurde am nächsten Tag repariert, allerdings lief das Wasser den Wänden entlang hinunter, da bei der Blechbadewanne keine Abdichtungen vorhanden waren.\nLeider konnte ich einerseits wegen dem Lärm auf der Strasse verursacht durch laute Stimmen trotz geschlossener Fenster nicht schlafen. Zudem war das Bett mit der billigsten IKEA-Matratze ausgestattet, was mir erhebliche Rückenschmerzen bereitete.\nBeim TV lag ein ca. 15 Meter langes Kabel, das durch die halbe Wohnung gezogen hätte werden müssen... \nLast but not least: Bei meiner Ankunft befand sich schmutziges Geschirr und Besteck in der Spühlmaschine, die ich nicht in Gang bringen konnte.\nIch empfehle Elisabeth, diese aus meiner Sicht \"\"no goes\"\" - auch im Vergleich zum zu bezahlenden Preis in Ordnung zu bringen. In diesem Fall würde ich die Wohnung vorbehaltlos empfehlen.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I’ve never had a bad Airbnb experience, but I’d also never had an outstanding one until Jose’s. The location is perfect. There’s a grocery store outside the front door. The apartment is basically a workout studio with bench and kettlebells. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen is fully stocked. The shower is hot, with heated tiles. Really, it was wonderful. And Jose was a warm, welcoming host. I wish I could give it six stars.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>José was a great host. Met us at the apartment and was very thorough telling us how everything works. \nHe gave us tips of places to visit and was always on hand if we needed to get in touch. \nThe location was great! We could walk to many places nearby and the Metro was very close by, linking us to everywhere we wanted to go. \nThe flat was small but cosy, very clean and comfy and had everything we needed. Be aware it is 4 floors up so lots of stairs. One of my friends has a bad knee so it was a shock for her but absolutely fine for the rest of us. \nWe had a great stay and would definitely recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nils place was energized with goodness and special, and its good to observe your host interested in providing great hospitality! The room I booked was unavailable and I was consequently changed rooms to 'Warm room with working place'. I asked and received a refund for my unhappiness.  \nBesides having a good final stay, I removed one star for the difficulty of the booking process.  First, I was informed one date was not available even though it was displayed on airbnb as available.  Next the room was not available! again displayed on airbnb as available. As a youth I cannot understand  :----)  What's going wrong? Might be a transient issue as no one has commented on a same experience. Communication was good. Checkin/Checkout very good. My review is about 'Warm room with working place' which is the other listing (the other of Nil's rooms)..Room was clean and big with many amenities. The working place was not comfortable, but not all travelers intend to work. If you do, don't-- I had to actually work ;) (Uni student).. and don't recommend it like that. \n\nNil is a warm, energized host and I expect he will improve and fix things as reviews come..  I positively recommend despite the unhappy details! Thanks Nil.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I didn't see Anna, her friend met me and gave the keys. The apartment is small, clean and tidy. But we were a bit confused by the bad smell in the kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet, metro is very close</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>El piso de Hakan está mug bien ubicado. La limpieza no es suprema pero no está mal. Me sentó mal que me cobrar por una quinta persona cuando no había espacio adecuado para dormir para más de 4 personas. Además de eso me hizo falta el microondas \n\nHakan's place is very well located. Cleanings aren't supreme but aren't bad. I felt sad about being charged extra for a fifth person when there wasn't appropriate place for a fifth person to sleep (no sheets, 1 sofá-bed for very small people (1,50 length) and another sofa bed with rough pattern. Also there weren't enough covers for all of us) I also missed the microwave in the breakfast.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We had a great stay at Ronja's place! The flat is truly a little gem, it's super cozy, decorated with art & it's in a beautiful area of Stockholm (probably the best!). The host was very kind, communicative and easy going, you can't go wrong here! Cheers and Thanks.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place was amazing! It was like having a private hotel suite!! Sergio was so kind to stay up waiting for us, I felt so bad about it. Definitely do your research when staying here if you're not familiar with the Stockholm area. Walkable to everything, clean, comfortable and really cute place!! Totally recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastic place!! Too bad i only have 2 nights to spend here</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The flat was beautiful and in a great location. Alex welcomed us and showed us everything when we arrived, there is just about everything you can possibly need in this flat. The open plan living/dining/kitchen area is much bigger than we expected and it is very light, with two great big windows. The kitchen is well equipped, as is the bathroom and the shower is fantastic - very powerful. The bedroom area is cosy, but not oppressive as it is not completely shut off. There is more storage in this flat than I've ever had anywhere else (including my own home!). And then there is the fun part... the multitude of light switches, each lighting one of the many areas and corners of the place, including the coving and the inside of the bedroom porthole. Very futuristic. By the end of the week we got the hang of which one was which, but we enjoyed getting it wrong several times before that (you think you're going to put the bedroom lights on and a blue circle lights up on the living room ceiling instead... then it turns green). \nThe location of the flat couldn't have been more perfect, only a few minutes walk from the tube station, around the corner to many cool bars and cafes, but at the same time really quiet and tranquil. We would recommend this place to anyone who is thinking of spending a bit of time in Stockholm. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Martin war absolut der perfekte Gastgeber!!!\r\nWir fanden alles genau so vor, wie wie es auf den Fotos und der Beschreibung dargestellt wurde.\r\nKommuniziert wurde bestens über alle medialen Kanäle.\r\nDie Nachbarschaft war sehr freundlich und diskret mit anliegendem Park.\r\nUnser Hund Lissi konnte super im Park joggen und im Meer baden.\r\n\r\nWir kommen mit Freuden wieder,\r\nHannah und Sven mit Töchtern & Hund Lissi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stort fint hus i en lugn grön omgivning och samtidigt nära till Stockholms centrum. I närheten finns T-banestationen Västertorp, affärer och pizzerier. Vi bodde här 11 dagar i juli, badade ofta i den uppvärmda poolen och saknade ingenting. Huset har allt man behöver. Vi var 4 vuxna (2 föräldrar och 2 vuxna barn) och en hund och vi hade gott om plats, inne och utomhus.\nMartin är en vänlig och omtänksam värd som svarar direkt om man behöver hjälp.\nEtt bättre hus och semester kan man verkligen inte önska sig.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Best place to be.

Gerade wenn man mit Kindern unterwegs ist, ist alles da: Spielzeug, Babybadewanne, Hochstuhl und sogar ein Kinderwagen!\nFür die Eltern gibt es dann eine extra Entspannung vor dem Kamin!\nDie Wohnung liegt in einer der besten Straßen von Vasastan mit Cafés, Restaurants und Shops. Spielplätze sind auch gleich ums Eck. \nMalin antwortet immer sofort, was die Kommunikation sehr einfach macht!\nMöchte man den perfekten Stockholmurlaub , sollte man Malins Wohnung buchen!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ander´s house is very lovely. We stayed there for five days and had nice holidays. We did not not have any problems with our hosts or the house. A wonderful lake is nearby the house. There is also a local airport. Sometimes you could hear some airplane noises, but this was not that bad. If you stay in Brommaplan it is easy to go to Stockholm by bus and metro. Furthermore the beautiful palace Drottingholm is not far away and a wonderful place to visit. \n\nWe were very happy to be guests in this house!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Det var fint å bo hos Anders. Han var imøtekommende og en glad vert. Veldig barnevennlig, 100 m til badeplass med brygge og idyllisk med epletrær og uteplass.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything went just as expected. The apartment, neighbourhood etc. were just like pictured on the listing. Annette responses quickly to messages and she offered us  a lot of flexibility with the check-in and check-out times which we badly needed. I will fully recommend Annette as a host and her apartment as a place to stay. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Stayed here for the entire month of August. Communication was primarily via email. Annette greeted me with a warm welcome & gave me a quick tour to show me everything I needed to know. When I 1st arrived it was Unbearably Hot & I had to open all the windows Because for whatever reason, Stockholm had the hottest summer in over a 100 years & nobody has AC, & every place was sold out of fans. But by the time I left I had to wear my jacket & kept all the windows closed. The weather is crazy! Usually, it's supposed to rain in the summer mostly, but when I was there it didn't rain much at all. Anyway, Annette was so nice to leave me some fruit-- watermelon, kiwi, pineapple, & some wine. The neighborhood/little community is very quiet, but usually the kids will play outside two times a day, so that's the only time it gets noisy. My advice for travelers is to bring an eye mask because the sun RISES AT 3AM!!! So that really messes you up if you're a morning person like me, because my body naturally wakes up as soon as the sun comes up. I had my own eye mask, and Annette had one for me to use too but I used my heavy vest to completely cover my head to block out the light. At night, these little fast-crawling bugs come out, but I think that's just everywhere in Stockholm Because I saw them at the other place I stayed at before I got to Annette's place. Some of her plants started withering so I bought another one because I felt bad that a plant died on me during my stay. Annette didn't ask me/give me any Instructions on watering the plants, so I just gave them some water here & there. I also broke the glass container for water so I replaced it with another one. Overall I had a pleasant stay, but Stockholm is an Expensive place. I think two weeks is good enough to explore the city because there's not much to do besides go museum hopping. The ppl are nice & helpful but it's hard to make friends there. (I attended MANY social gatherings & classes but bumped into familiar faces as well so Stockholm isn't a very big city- you May run into the same people after a while). This is the first time I stayed at an Airbnb that someone lived in, so it was a different experience for me. I think in the future I would prefer to stay at an Airbnb where it's Not someone's full time Home; just because I prefer more privacy. The Laundry is free but you're supposed to \"\"reserve\"\" your time slot for when you want to do your laundry. I never did that though. I just walked in and used it if there was a free machine. The dryer did not dry the clothes completely after one cycle though...\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed here for 10 days in August 2019. Annette is a friendly and generous host who offered all the assistance we needed. \nThe apartment is basically one big room with kitchen, sitting area and a daybed, and a bedroom. It is stylishly decorated and has everything you might need in your daily life - from hairdryer to dishwasher, Netflix to washing machine.\nThis is an excellent location - walking distance to the shops and restaurants of stylish Södermalm, yet quiet at night. There's a large park right out the front door, so you can sit and read or play with your kids. A supermarket is a minute away, bus stops and metro stations also nearby. I especially enjoyed the fantastic public swimming pool Erikdalsbadet (also in walking distance, about 1 km). Entry fee is 70-90 crowns, then you can enjoy both 50 m and 25 m pools (inside and ouside) as well as various smaller pools and a sauna.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Annette is a great host. She welcomed us in person and explained everything in great detail. The place was clean and even towels were provided. She was even nice enough to get us some groceries for breakfast! \nWe stayed with six adults which was perfectly fine. \nThe appartement isn’t located in the heart of the city, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s quiet and peaceful. Train and metro are just a small walk away and the bus stops around the corner. So it’s easy to get around from here place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Had a wonderful stay at Ahmed's. He went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. He gave me loads of really great recommendations on places to eat and even did my washing for me! His place is really clean and the bed is super comfortable. Great location - in the heart of hipster central - you're never too far from a good cup of coffee. Very walkable to the old town or to the city center. Only slight downside is that if Ahmed is staying at the same time he has to sleep on the couch which I felt really bad about. But I'd 100% recommend the stay. Ahmed is an amazing superhost.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Appartment matching the description, cosy and perfectly suitable for cocooning and visit Stockholm (on the very heart of city center). \nFew wrong notes : The apartment should be perfectly clean on arrival  and, in the case of standalone check-in (our case), the host should be more available around check-in (even if many precisions have been give us). Outside of that, Björn \ncan give all advices you need about the journey.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My colleague and I had a lovely time at Eva's place.\nEverything is nice, clean and tidy and Eva was very responsive.\nTo bad we were coming and going so early and late and didn't get a real chance to meet her properly.\nThank you Eva!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het appartement ligt in een rustige buurt, vlakbij het water en 20 minuutjes vanaf het centrum. Ideaal na een drukke dag in de stad! de kamer is mooier dan op de foto's, een goed 2 persoonsbed (2 losse bedden aan elkaar) en licht en sfeervol ingericht. de badkamer is vrij klein, maar dat was geen enkel probleem, het was allemaal schoon. Anita is erg gastvrij, je mocht haar spulletjes lenen in de keuken, en ze had ook dingen zoals een kleed voor bij het water en een heleboel dvd's! Ik zou zeker terugkomen als ik weer naar Stockholm ga.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dit is een verzorgd appartement, schoon en vv alle faciliteiten (wifi, was-/droogmachine, tv, PS, badkamer etc). Op korte afstand van Metro waardoor prima uitvalsbasis voor een city trip. \nEten haal je om de hoek bij Phills of pizzaria.  Top.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I dont have a bad word to say. Spent 4 nights at Evas place I slept like a log. Eva was very friendly and the are was awesome. 5/5</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>My friend Nick and I were traveling and needed a place to stay in Stockholm after previous arrangements sunk (literally...boat-wise). \r\n\r\nAirbnb to the rescue!\r\n\r\nWe looked through a few listings and decided upon Eva's residence. Very glad we made that choice! Eva welcomed us on Day 1, and after that we didn't see her much, but she was always available and always kind and willing to help with any issue. The room itself is comfortable enough for two and the bed provided some needed R&R after long days out and about in the city. \r\n\r\nThough you can't really go wrong with location in the awesome city of Stockholm, this was a good base. It is a short 5-10 minute walk to the Metro station and is right down the street from a Kiwi store for any groceries or supplies you may need. The island of Gamla Stan (the old city) is within walking distance as well, it'll take maybe 20-25 minutes or so.\r\n\r\n*All times are estimates based on someone's memory who may not be the best =]*\r\n\r\nThis is a trip Nick and I will not soon forget, and I just want to thank Eva for letting us stay here and for being such a gracious host! \r\n\r\nNext time I'm in Stockholm, I know where to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi hade två trivsamma veckor i Dan’s lägenhet i juni 2019. Lägenheten är mycket väl utrustad, allt var också rent och välstädat. Gott om plats för våra saker i både kök och sovrum vilket uppskattades mycket. Bra centralt läge på Söder. Allt fungerade överlag bra, och vi fick snabba svar på våra frågor. Enda lilla nackdelen vi fann var att den enda toaletten ligger avskild från badrummet.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Din lägenhed ligger på toppen fra Bredäng T-bana og det er en specielt oplevelse.

We rented some bikes and it is very advisable. The house is not big but enough for a couple of even 3 people for a few days. The room has a double bed and the living room has a comfortable double bed sofa. There is also a cute terrace you can take advantage of is the weather lets you. \r\nThe only bad point was the bathroom, very small. The floor of the shower is the floor of the bathroom, and it was quite stinky I think because of the pipes. \r\nAnja left some available space for our staff.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nära T-banan, eget badrum, stort rum.

It was dirty, and just worsen off as my days there went by.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Well, because Eddin was soooo good, so we decided to stay for one more night :P  (just kidding )actually there’s something wrong with our return ticket, so we stayed for another night.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>On arrival we discovered that half the house was without power including the bathroom, refrigerator, tv, wifi and living areas. This was incredibly frustrating as we had bought some groceries on our way which could not be refrigerated and we had to shower in the dark (including our toddler). The host sent someone to look at it the next day but it was a huge inconvenience. \n\nThere were also unwashed clothes in the washing machine, wet clothes in the dryer and dirty dishes in the dishwasher which we had to clean up. Also there was no toilet paper. No explanation was given by the host as to why. We queried the host if there was some and she said yes but it could not be found. Both toilet seats were also broken. \n\nThe house itself is nice and well furnished however some chair were broken and there are a number of large stains around the house. The door to the bathroom / bedroom area was also broken which meant that it could not be closed and that area was open to the dining room which wasn’t great when sharing with a friend.\n\nThe location is great in the old town but given the issues in the house and our bad experience I would not recommend staying here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ett hemtrevligt och mysigt rum.

He was easy to communicate with and flexible in our check out and check in! \nHis apartment is very cosy and clean and located close to busses and trains! It is some nice interior and the couch is not bad to sleep on (of you need two beds)! \nOverall a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a well located apartment on the third floor in Sodemalm.  It is nicely furnished and comes with all the amenities you would expect.  Best to take an Uber into town but there is plenty to do in Sodermalm and the walk to Old City isn't bad.  The apartment is very spacious and light.  I would definitely stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Per was very nice to send us the directions before we arrived and he also met us at the subway station on our first day. The place is very spacious, proper for 2 people stay. The kitchen is available and we were able to prepare our breakfast at home. The transportation to the city center is very easy, the place is 3 mins to the subway and it takes only one line to T-centralen. However the place was very cold when we arrived because the heating was not functioning then, but I guess it was our bad luck. The cleaning was alrighty. All in all we had a good experience during our stay besides than malfunctioning heating.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Per provided the most comprehensive guide I've ever seen. I was still lost though but Per fetched me from the wrong side of road immediately when I called him. The room is spacious and there is a big comfortable desk allowing me continuing work on my laptop. Thank you Per.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Let’s start with the good aspects: Its a cheap place compared to other locations around Stockholm plus you have access to everything you need like food, easy access to metro and so on.\nI never had problems with AirBnB hosts before, BUT I have to say Per was a really rude person to me at some point. He claimed I wouldn’t respect the house rules by putting loud music on plus I would slam doors. I only put 5 minutes of not to loud music on with my cellphone while taking a shower and he wanted to teach me a lesson by putting his subwoofers on that this wasn’t fine instead of having a conversation with me about it in first place. We could agree on quietness afterwards, but a couple of days later he bought up the door slamming thing which wasn’t true at all and we almost got into a fight.\n\nIf you’re the quietest person on earth, you might do well with Per, but if you put any music on at some point or not closing the doors in the most quiet way possible, you will get in trouble with him. I really couldn’t get along with him.\nI hate to write bad reviews here and never did it before, but you should know who you’re dealing with when you move in with Per.\n\nBecause of his attitude I would never come back and he probably would agree that its better that I don’t come back either.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fanny var lite sen vid incheckning (30 min) men skrev då flera gånger och bad om ursäkt och gjorde allt för att vi inte skulle behöva vänta (erbjöd sig att buda över nyckel osv). Annars ingenting som utmärkte sig. Fin lgh - precis som på bilderna & Fanny var en grym värd, gav tips. Centralt, bra kommunikation m tunnelbana osv. Rekommenderas verkligen!! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Susanne is a wonderful and generous host. She picked me up from the station to save me walking the 6 minutes or so with my luggage and also helped me practice my bad Swedish :) The room itself is very nice and feels private. It is in the basement, but it is not dark or claustrophobic at all as I had feared.  The house is only about 20 mins from the center. Would definitely recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Min vecka på Viktor och Beata var väldigt trevlig. Deras lägenhet var perfekt, med ett stort sovrum, mycket tyst och centralt (6 minuter från T). Köket och badrummet var välutrustade och rena.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I don't want to see this bad experience again .</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I must say I don't have a good memory there. When we communicated online, I have told her I will arrive much early and wanna to put our baggage at her house first . Park gave me an affirmative answer. But when I arrived at her place around 7: 30 am. I cannot contact her anymore, even made phone calls 3or4 times, still no reply ! We just stood at the outside and waited for more than 3 hours! I felt so bad, although the last knocking on the door , she opened. That 's my story. I won't choose it any more!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice apartment which correspond to the annonce. A little bad point with the smell of cold cigarette in the flat. Anyway this apartment is convenient for a short stay in Stockholm and is pretty chip for the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Johan's place was a very nice apartment with a great price. It was very clean and modern with not a bad location in Stockholm. Only about a 10-15 minute train ride to anywhere in the city, and it was only a few blocks from the closest station! Johan was also very easy to communicate with and arrange anything we needed. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ray's place is amazing, decoration is something very special and unique. All is so beautiful, from the smallest details. Apartment is very clean and comfortable.  Futon beds,  sheets, kitchenware, all top quality. He had even left yoga mats for guests! I got inspired by his home.  Too bad we couldn't stay longer!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great apartment. Perfect location, close to everything and easy walking around the city. The apartment was clean and spacious, perfect for two couples exploring Stockholm. My husband love the hard bed but it was a bit too hard for me with a bad hip and knee. Otherwise the place was perfect. I recommend everyone to stay here in this amazing location to see Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lena svarte raskt på meldinger, var alltid positiv og hjelpsom. Leilgheten er romslig og flott, lys og luftig, selv om badet er veldig lite. Kan absolutt anbefale å bo her. Lena hjalp oss også med tips til resturanter og barer i nærheten:)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rigtig charmerende og rummelig lejlighed med personligt præg. Skønt spisekøkken og dejlig altan. Eneste minus er det lille badeværelse. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The Pink House has been a great and really enjoyable surprise.\nIt is the typical Swedish wooden house placed in a lovely and very typical neighborhood, well located to easily reach the city center by metro and very close to the wonderful beach of Mälarhöjdsbadet, where you can both have wonderful walks or swim.\nThe room was really nice, warm and with a nice view on the surrounding gardens where you can also see some running deer. \nBjorn is a very good host, always ready to give his full support and best advice in order to plan your visit and enjoy your staying.\n\nSTRONGLY RECOMMENDED!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bjorn's home is in a quiet and beautiful part of Stockholm, and we certainly feel we made the right choice in location. There are many pleasant walks to do along the banks of Lake Mälaren and in the immediate surroundings, and the Tunnelbana station is less than 5 minutes' walk away. It takes only 20 minutes to reach the city centre, and the transport services are frequent, efficient, reliable and on-time. I would certainly recommend the local walks down to Mälarhöjdsbadet and also to Vinterviken (where Alfred Nobel had his dynamite factories). Bjorn is a very friendly, easy going and helpful host, and his dog Nova loves to play with the guests. We would definitely recommend Bjorn's pink house to every one.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Der Aufenthalt bei Björn war super. Die Umgebung ist eizigartig und wunderschön. \nWir können es nur weiter empfehlen. \nMan brauch nicht lang in die Stadt und wenn man bei warmen Tagen mal nur bis um 5 in der Stadt sein möchte dann kann man im See gleich um die Ecke bei Björn baden gehen. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cosy little place with some character, perfectly situated in Södermalm, very close to some great viewpoints and loads of fun restaurants, shops and bars nearby too. \n\nI asked for an early check in due to a work call and Pär accommodated me right away. \n\nIt’s on the ground floor and there was some construction work outside the window in the morning, but nothing too bad. Very quiet and peaceful in the evenings. Overall good value, would come back.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>They are not good people and in very bad form</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It 'was a disappointment to find small rooms in the house where it was difficult to move around, there were no towels we had to buy, a small room was made virtually under the stairs, so small it was barely a single bed, without window. There was a small leak of water that wet the bed.\nToo bad because the location of the house is good, in a nice quiet neighborhood and convenient to public transportation, metro and bus stop in front of the house</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The price is cheap and nothing to say any bad. But, it cannot be counted as comfortable. It is good for quick stay. More than 3 days, I am not suggested</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Weird layout, bad sound insulation, but very worth the money</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Unbearably noisy shabby first-floor flat, window without double-glazing opening directly on a very busy street so that sleeping is made impossible. Furthermore, dirty mattress casing, electric sockets hanging unprotected off the wall, no cooking possible, wrong door codes provided on website and no answer from the owner on our different requests... To be shunned absolutely !</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It's in an excellent location. You can go by walking almost everywhere and you also have the underground just in front of a bus stop.\nIt's very comfortable and clean.\nNothing bad to comment. Having just a microwave wasn't a problem for just two days, if you plan to stay more you may miss a proper kitchen but for a few days with the micro is enough.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is in great location. For good and bad when u get there it looks like a room stuck in the 60's. The bathroom is clean but in my case not the bed. It wasn't prepared and full of stains and dust. The price is good for Stockholm and therefore it is not great but totally acceptable for a 1 night stay (not ideal for couples). </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Es erwartet Euch ein ca. 25 m² 1- Zimmer Apartement im 60/70 ziger Stil mit vielen kleinen Lichtquellen und eingerichtet mit einem Doppelbett, einer kleinen Küchenzeile und einem neuen Duschbad.\nEs ist alles vorhanden, was man für einen Urlaub braucht und ich fand es gemütlich. \nDie Wohnung liegt im Erdgeschoss, ist ruhig und man schaut auf einen Hof mit einem Fahrradunterstand. \nEs ist ein angenehmes Stadtviertel zum Wohnen, 2 große Supermärkte sind in der Nähe und die U-Bahn erreicht man in ca. 6 min zu Fuß. Zum Hauptbahnhof sind es nur 2 Haltestellen mit der blauen U-Bahnlinie.\nDer Check in und die Kommunikation verliefen problemlos.\nIch habe mich dort sehr wohl gefühlt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>You really can’t get much better! This flat is definitely one of the quietest stays. You have a 7/11 around the corner, a coop down the road, and the city shopping is just a few minutes walking distance. You can rent a little scooter and get from the flat to the central train station in 5 mins or a 15-20 min walk. Transport is so easy from the airport to the flat you just get on one bus and then walk or scooter. There are great places to eat & cafe around. I don’t understand people who have complained about the bed above the kitchen it’s insanely comfortable. I’m 5’0 and had no troubles! The only annoyance is the shower because it is open but it really isn’t bad. I mean the water pressure is good, the shower is hot, and the flat is private. Absolutely great stay! My mate and I had a fab time. Tom is a great host too!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great place at perfect location.\n\nWe accidentally left a wrong set of keys when we checked out (again, sorry!) but the landlord was cool with it, and as we were still in Stockholm we could rectify the situation quickly.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My first bad Airbnb experience:\n\nAs i always do, I booked the whole apartment, and of course we had the Airbnb confirmation email. But when we arrived there, Sara said we only rented one bed and asked 200€ cash extra, or she would not leave the apartment.\n\nWith the jet lag and the stress to not have a place to sleep (we really needed 2 beds), we made the stupid mistake to give her the 200€ cash. The next day, after doublechecking with Airbnb, we had indeed rented the whole place and ask her for the money back. Airbnb try to reach her as well, they wrote back to us: After 24h, we have no reply from Sara. \n\nBut here’s the thing... when she finally left, surprisingly her belongings were ready by the door in a big bag! That suggest to me that she knew we rented the whole place and that she was not planing to sleep there those 4 nights. \n\nIt’s the very first time I have problem with a host. It is very confusing for me to see the good comments here about her. The Sara described here is not representing the Sara i met at all!\n\nWe saved money for a year for this trip, this is extremely frustrating as 200Euro is 300$ canadian, and its a lot for me. :-(\n\nOn check out day, I insisted to get back the 200€. She refused to reimburse. I regret I didn’t insist more.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pluses: Victors house is in a pretty good location. It is small but cozy. Not a bad price for Stockholm. Minuses: He was living there up until the moment I arrived and his clothes were scattered around the house. Half-eaten food in the fridge, half-used packets in the cupboards so I had no room for my own food. He charges me a $30 cleaning fee but then he got angry that I left the place not clean, what is the cleaning fee for?</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This house full os students was amazing ! I have been 1 month and I would absolutely recommend it. First of all  the house is located in a tranquil area surrounded by more houses  ( It is a safe area and my housemates and I have gone out many times until late and nothing bad  has happened ) .The kitchen is very big and it is very well equipped ! The room was very good and it has a big desk to study and the sights from the window were very nice. Although it has 2 bathrooms (and a half ) for many people, when I was there I could have a shower or go to the toilet whenever I want and I did not have to wait to enter.  My housemates were very nice and the atmosphere was incredibly good! I am sure that if I come back to that area , I will repeat.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi er et par på 31 og 34 år, der havde fornøjelsen af at bo hos Anna i 3 dage. Anna er en utrolig hjælpsom, betænksom, fleksibel, gæstfri og sød vært. Lejligheden er rigtig pæn og ren og er godt indrettet. Der er et stort og lækkert badeværelse, et skønt værelse med en dejlig seng samt tilhørende hyggelig og stor altan. Lejligheden ligger utrolig godt. Nær spisesteder (brunch, sushi, osv), tæt på vandet med mulighed for at bade og sole samt supermarked (ICA). Dog ligger lejligheden en 30-40 minutters gang ind til centrum. Hele opholdet overgik i den grad vores forventninger. Når vi skal tilbage til Stockholm, vil vi klart booke hos Anna igen.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Totally recommend Sofi's place.  Complete 5-Star.  You absolutely can't beat the location.  Apartment is very clean, comfortable, and stylish.  Exactly as described.  Sofi made check in/out extremely easy.  You won't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I'm conflicted in writing this review. Sofi, the host, was very friendly. The apartment itself is conveniently located. We booked it for 3 nights based on its location, and the fact that it has a washer/dryer (a 2-in-1 unit); since Stockholm was half-way into our 2 week trip, me and the Mrs. just packed a week's worth of clothing, and cleaned our clothes prior to departing. Save the washing machine, the positives are mainly due to location and not the unit itself. Nice looking hotel rooms in Gamla Stan were comparable in price for the nights we stayed, but again, the washing machine was a huge bonus for us. Now for the bad. Two things. (I don't include the loud noise, as it's common to the area and well advised by the friendly owner.) ONE: When we first arrived, it seemed as though the cleaning lady had not finished before leaving. the washing machine was running its drying cycle. There was a squeegee in the middle of the floor. To my disgust, the blue bed sheets were clearly dirty - hair follicles and what appeared to be dried, white stains. I immediately pulled out what was in the laundry machine (a super absorbent bath mat) and cleaned the sheets. I contacted the host on this, and she assured me the sheets were clean. Bollocks. My eyes did not lie to me. The hair and stains were gone after I ran the sheets through the wash. TWO: As other reviewers state, the shower has drainage issues. This could be remedied by a day or 2 of work in fixing the flooring / drainage in the bathroom, or even the sealing / caulking to the shower. I believe this to be solely an income property, and never owner-occupied, so perhaps this is not a pressing issue for the arm's-length owner. After the first 2 days, the \"\"clean\"\" bath mat that I pulled out of the laundry machine really began to smell. BAD. REALLY BAD. As in</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I never stay in hostels, but this one wasn't that bad. The location is what made it great, but I just didn't like that the rooms are mixed with males and females. Should be same-gender rooms. Other than that, the location is super central and right next to the Stockholm central station.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Delphi's place is in a nice spot in Stockholm, very close to the metro, and not a bad walk acrossed the bridge to Sodermalm. The room was large, and the bed was comfortable. It should be noted that it is a bed within the living room, and it is divided by a sheet, not a door. Otherwise, everything is as described. Would recommend if you are visiting Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was very nice stay in Viveka's house. Firstly I thought a littlle bit far from city central on a map, but it was wrong.\nthe house is close to the bus stop and easy to get a train station \nAnd also Viveka told me a good place to see around Stockholm.\nIt was useful introduction for me.\nAround the house, there are so much nature and I could hear birds voice and feel nature wind.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I booked Viveka's place literally at last min. For that price I knew it wasn’t in the city center. I'd suggest taking a cab if you have a lot of luggage as it takes a subway ride, a bus ride, and some walking to get to the apartment. Very spacious room, but the bed is quite small, more of a couch than a bed. Lovely and thoughtful host. My bad for not abiding by the checkout time which caused her stress.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is located in a quiet area within 20min walking distance to the central station. Supermarket is 15min walk and restaurants are around the corner. The bed was very comfortable. Kitchen had everything needed.\n\nThe place had a bad smell from the bathroom and we had to sleep with open window. There was no toilet paper provided and a hair dryer was also missing.\n\nThe door code in the description was wrong and we tried to get in for half an hour before we got the new one.\n\nFor our questions there were no responses from the host.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Nice apartment in central location. The door code was wrong and we didn't receive the correct code until 8.30pm on the day of arrival. Calls weren't answered. No toilet paper and hair dryer.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Host was very nice and gave instructions that were helpful on what forms of public transportation to take. The beds were comfortable and the room is as it looks in photos. Not in the city but very close to a metro stop (3 mins walk). Alex’s roommate can be very loud when she talks and the walls are thin. You get what you pay for and overall not a bad place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place was nice and pretty. Better than in the pictures. \nTwo of us have mold allergy and We got really bad symptoms at the place. We needed to TaKe allergy pills to manage. That is Why We couldn’t stay at the place during the days. We just slept there windows open and With the help of medicine. \nSo if you are sensitive this way, this is not the best place. \nIf you are not, the place is otherwise great!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a very good stay at Klaras flat. It is situated near by supermarkets and restaurants. We had a car and could easily drive to a lake within 10 minutes. We left the car in a garage, which was quite inexpensive. The flat has a cosy living-room, a big kitchen and a nice terrace. All rooms were very clean and comfortable. Nothing was missing. We didn’t get to know Klara, but she left us notes and chocolate! We had a bit bad luck, because the metro had to be prepared, so the way into the city took us about 40 min. But this problem will not stay long. Klara was very helpful. She gave us lot of informations and contacted us always very quickly. We would recommend the flat to everyone, who liked to stay in a residential area, in a cozy flat within the real Swedish way of living. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastic location and lovely place. Perfect as long as you are fine with the hike up several flights of stairs - we considered it good exercise! Some comments have said street noise was an issue, and it is above some nightlife spots but we did not find the noise bad. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The room was not as advertised, The room had paint that was unfinished. The dishwasher was broken, the electrical wiring was bad as well. The location how ever is really good also the big TV in the bedroom is amazing. Other than that it is not really worth the price.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I really liked this apartment. Perfect location close to the station, restaurants, etc. It was clean clean, charming, and cozy. Even some original artwork. Nice little kitchen reasonably equipped for light cooking. Nice limited rooftop view and very quiet. Good for two only. Couples could push together the single beds. Stairs aren't bad and the building has lots of character. Good value too.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het huisje is te bereiken na diverse deuren met in totaal 4 trappen van 22 treden.\n\nHet is een klein huisje met schuine daken. Twee losse bedden in de kleine huiskamer met open kleine keuken. Vloeren lopen schuin. Een douche in de toiletruimte. Het is eigenlijk niet een badkamer te noemen. \n\nBuurt is erg leuk. In het centrum van Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Location, location, location. Nice studio with enough space for two people. Very helpful with the reservation and saved us because of a wrong date reservation.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had four people and a baby so space was a little bit tight but Sofi’s place is in a great location so we were okay with that. It was comfortable, cozy and had everything we needed. Stairs were not bad and building was secure. Sofi was quick to respond with any inquires I had. I even asked for more towels and she had them delivered within half an hour. Very quick! Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for everything, Sofi!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>No lift for the top floor... But not a problem for young travelers. \nWonderful location, easy to walk to stations and attractions.\nFacilities are bit worse than my expectations.\nOverall it had better value than pay a hotel room in the same location.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great weekend stay! I have nothing bad to say about this place</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bathroom to to small - only slim fit person can have a shower inside, even he/she would not feel comfortable in this very small bathroom.\nRoom was to cold; heaters were not plugged in. After we did it, it took 3 hours to get the room warmer.\nWifi also didn’t work- it was plugged out also. Those should be prepared by host and they should work.\nLocation was perfect.\nEntrance to apartment was not easy and the lower floor smelled badly.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ifølge Airbnb kommer man til at bo i folks hjem. Lad mig slå fast: Fredriks lejlighed er ikke Fredriks hjem, det er en rent kommerciel udlejningslejlighed. Fredrik selv kunne lige så godt være ikke-existerende og min korrespondance med ham rent virtuel. Der er ikke noget køkken, hvad der ville have været i et hjem, man kan altså ikke lave mad. Der er 2 mikrobølgeovne og 2 køkkenvaske, man kan varme færdigretter og take-away, men lave mad, det kan man ikke. Der er også en lille opvaskemaskine.\n\nEllers er lejligheden meget pæn og rummelig, med et badeværelse og et mindre gæstetoilet. Der er dejligt stille trods de mange ret larmende barer og kafeer på pladsen, dog megen støj fra en af barerne på hjørnet av Kornhamnstorg. Lejligheden ligger på 5. sal, og trapperne kan godt føles meget slemme. Lejligheden bliver også meget varm, når vejret er så strålende solrigt og varmt, som da vi var der (sidste uge i maj).\n\nFredrik så vi som allerede nævnt ikke skyggen af, heller ikke selv om han åbenbart har kontor i ejendommen. Vi blev  modtaget  af hans ”housekeeper”, Mamoud, som taler engelsk, men ikke svensk. Han var meget hjælpsom og hjalp os op og ned med bagagen, da vi henholdsvis kom og rejste.\n\nAlt i alt en god oplevelse.\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We were eight adults staying in the apartment for three nights and we had a great time in this cosy and charming apartment, perfectly situated in Gamla Stan. \nThe stairs up was no problem and we didn’t hear any noise neither from the street nor the neighbors. \nThe kitchen facilitets were ok for us only having cold dishes and perfect with two coffee machines and two refrigerators. \nOf course it was a little challenging just having one shower with a limit of hot water for eight people, but with a little goodwill it went well, and fortunately there are two toilets. \nThe only thing we were dissatisfied with was the bad sofa bed in the small room, which at one end is only a hard board, and that there was no curtain at the sloping ceiling window in the same room. \nThere is a sofa bed in the living room, but none of us would like to sleep in there when someone walks through at night or early morning to get to one of the toilets.  \nWe really can recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great Location, very central and close to everything.\nTo our surprise one of the rooms featured in the description was locked upon arrival, a bit of a pity since that was the only room with a small balcony. Could have been a miss-communication between me and the host. The rest of the communication was very good. Another surprise was the absence of a stove top, again, I might not have read the description thoroughly enough but in apartment of that since I would expect to able to cook simpler meals. Overall, not as good as I was expecting, but not a bad experience,</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Fantastic apartment in an excellent location. You can’t go wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is very good for sole or duet living with cosy books reading theme not for family get togather.\nFredrik is very good in communications and courties on emails prior to check in .\nAmenities is not ideal for big familiy get togather, \nPlace is very good accesible from city centre, but not a single proper bed ( all sofa converted) \nsingle bathroom with very small crampled shower area\nI overlooked on kitchen not been mentioned in amenities, but with very small microwave oven it is very difficult to get food even heated up for big family. \nTV is on, but not a single channel works.\nI have put all garbage at last day, but it is very unconviient to put that in ground floor to be opend by keay and then clinb up (4 stairs) to keep the keys back before lock door. I could see some garbage bag from earlier occupant laying there, which shows even they faced issues. \n\nWith bad experiance with less blankets, towels and no proper bedings, coupled with very slow response and action, I feel basic question on the AIRBNB business model itself.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is perfect. Very good and responsive communication with host (although it was a service company, never talked to Fredrik). \n\nUnfortunately, bathroom was very bad. Its curtain was very close and it was hard not to touch it while showering. \n3 bedrooms were super small. One of the bedrooms is connected to another so may only be considered for kids. \nRooms are very noisy - there is some AC or vent fan outside which was vibrating and causing annoying noice in 2 bedrooms.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>DO NOT BOOK this flat if you want a comfortable sleep in a modern apartment! It looks great on the photos and it is big, but is more like a hostel in feel , and way more expensive than it should be. I can’t believe AirBnB have accepted it as worthy of the price being charged. \nI saw the reviews which said the beds were all sofa beds & ignored them because I thought the place looked modern, bright and quirky. I couldn’t have been more wrong: it was odd, stuck in the 1980s and the bathrooms were truly terrible! all beds were sofa beds; uncomfortable and only had single duvets to sleep under, with ancient bed linen. Not a nice stay at all. \nThe host is now refusing to refund me for 2 of the 3 nights we booked (for my husband’s 60th birthday treat) - even though I complained on the first morning, after arriving late the previous night. it’s a money making venture - it’s not someone’s real home - it’s managed by a management company - \nSTEER WELL CLEAR OF THIS APARTMENT!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house is not too bad but the shower experience is just terrible. The location is really good.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bad host. Aggressiv and bad attitude</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Me and my girlfriend stayed at this place for 2 weeks.\nThe apartment is in really good area at Gamla Stan. But we didn’t enjoyed the staying because is hard to sleep when you have so much light, the curtains doesn’t cover the windows so you get so much light. The shower is horrible, you don’t get so much hot water only at the beginning (2-4 min) and then is only cold water. \nIt was a problem also with the water on Thursday we didn’t have water for like 5 hours and on Saturday to Sunday so like 25 hours without water.\nThe guy who clean the apartment was the one who give us the keys at the beginning and he was really rude to us and with bad attitude. At the end he go to the apartment to get the keys back and he was worst then the first time we meet. He was so upset because we move some stuff in the apartment and he throw away ours stuff and tell us to leave, he scream on us and saying only bad words, we were scared like he looks like he want to hit us. Someone that is working for airbnb doesn’t supposed to have this behavior. It was the worst experience we ever had.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>To summarize the good bits: Ylva's appartment is in a quiet location in a good area, and you can easily reach it by team. Also, Oswaldo is a nice guy.\nLess convincing: Ylva is pretty bad in responding to your messages, the studio is really basic (e.g. not really OK for cooking) and walking from the old town is not such a good idea, i.e. more than 1 hour. In comparison: From the airport bus station (T-Centralen) to anywhere in the old town it was less than 20 minutes walking.\nWays forward? Book a room in the old town - less hassle and probably the same price or less, if you consider that you then do not need tram day cards. And if you have a car rental, then you can go for a good appartment further outside!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very bad and unresponsive host. We had reserved place but Ylva didn't response until the evening of the day which we needed to arrive. After trying to resolve the issue and try to work problems out, Ylva was very ignorant and just responded that it's not her problem. Would not recommend to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Man får ett rum med eget badrum och sovrum. Finns mikro, kylskåp och vattenkokare. Allt det nödvändiga så att man klarar sig. Smidig och lätt. Egen ingång.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It’s not so bad. But there are many things to improve</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is well-located, close to the subway and it's an easy access to downtown. The price is interesting for the city and the room was clean. But the shower could have use a little more scrubbing, and its door is almost falling apart. There is everything you need but it's definitely the minimum : no nightstand / shelf, and the little table isn't really straight (can be annoying to work on). \nThere's no soap in the shower, it's not a huge problem but it would have been nice to specify. The communication isn't very easy, I didn't get any confirmation message until 4hours before the check-in, even though I sent 2 messages on airbnb with my arrival time 3 days before. It can be a little stressful especially if you arrive late. Just a  quick message at the reservation would be nice. \nThere is one thing that needs to be changed : the pillows. They are really really bad (and I'm a hostel traveler, I'm really not picky, never complained in my life about that). \n\nSo none of those things are huge problems, and the place is convenient but it could be way better.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Smidig incheckning, litet kök med säng & badrum, handdukar & dusch & lakan! 5 min gång till tunnelbana, 10min in till stan :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This flat will make you feel like at home 100%!,here you will find what ever you need:good speed Internet,cable tv with all languages,full kitchen,lovely sofa at living room and fantastic soft and fresh bed.shower also cool,not small and hot water come fast. I cannot say something bad about host too-he meet me early,how I ask and was very friendly. Everything very clean and good.Area 1min from metro station and close to city center. Will glad to back to that home again</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ahmed is an excellent and very friendly host; he responds very quickly to any question you might have,  gave a very long and excellent list of restaurant and 'fika' suggestions in the area and even organized a taxi to the airport for us. The apartment itself is located just south of SoFo, an area full of nice (design and second hand) shops and restaurants. The Indian restaurant next door is not that bad,  either! The metro station is just around the corner and the metro brings you to Slussen, Gamla Stan and the central station in just minutes. A large ICA supermarket is just across the street. You can do laundry in the building and there is a good wifi connection. It occasionally disconnects (see some other reviews) but was always back within minutes. The bed and couch are very comfortable and the apartment is cosy and nicely decorated. I would definitely advise others to stay here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfect Quality/price ratio! Helena welcomed my girlfriend and I for a long weekend. The flat was perfectly located. Helena allowed us to arrive a little bit earlier just to drop our luggages  and allowed us (on the last day) to leave our luggages to her flat (in order for us to enjoy this last day in the city as much as possible). \nHelena took the time to give us useful informations about the commodities and public transports. Big thank you for that!\n\nThe little « bad » point would just be the shower which was not working properly (not much water coming). Otherwise everything was perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The kitchen and the bathroom are very dirty and messy. There was a bad smell in the whole flat and we didn't feel comfortable. At least the bedroom was quite okay and the communication with helena was good. Also the location is very good, near the centre. But anyways, no recommendation for that place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Väldigt trevlig lägenhet, fint kök, fräscht badrum och till ett rimligt pris! Hade en väldigt bra vistelse!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very nice place in the center of Stockholm. The room is small but has everything I needed - a workdesk, a bed, good lighting. The only thing I missed was a shelf for my toiletries bad in the bathroom. Great shower! Really appreciated everyday cleaning, new coffee and tea and good wifi. Plenty of restaurants nearby, 7-10 minutes walk to nearest subway. Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lugnt och fint, lättillgängligt med fina utemiljöer, bad och strövområden med bra kommunikationer inom räckhåll. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice host, neighborhood but ... no bed to sleep on, high noises during the night. No clean badroom and kitchen. The doorlocks where not working. This places needs an acute renovation.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was a bad room, for a Very expensive Price, sorry but, im not trying this room again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hans was very hospitable — shared fruit, coffee, and tips of what to go see. Great proximity to the metro (and also not a bad walk from walking the center of Stockholm). Would stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You cant go wrong staying with Hans, seriously awesome place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket nöjd med kontakten med Hans. Lätta att kommunicera med. Trots att Hans bodde i samma lägenhet märkte jag knappt av honom under tiden jag var i lägenheten. Bekväm säng och ett rent och prydligt rum. Jag kommer gärna tillbaka till honom nästa gång jag har ärende till Eriksdalsbadet. Perfekt läge när man ska hoppa simhopp!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I spent two days and a night with my teenage daughter at Hans’s place, and except for my kid getting sick on the second day it was great. But even spending a day sick in this cosy room was not that bad :) \n\nLocation is perfect, the place being quiet but close to Underground (don’t you miss it, especially the Blue line) and some shopping and eating places. Gamla Stan is a pleasant walk away. \n\nThe room is just fine, and Hans is a perfect host, caring and welcoming. My daughter says Hans is friendly and cheerful, although she doesn’t speak much English!\n\nI guess such places are airbnb value, when you get a scent of local ordinary life but feel comfortable as a guest at the same time. \n\nThere is also a nice old style elevator in the building and a quiet inner yard, interesting to get inside such a house sometimes, if you live somewhere completely different of course :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is by far the worst air bnb experience. This woman is an alcoholic and extremely bi polar. She used profanity towards me in front of my 7 year old child. She got upset we used the stove and started making false accusations about other things because I called her out about her sisters drunk boyfriend showing up to the house. She is unresponsive when I asked her for her first aid kid after cutting my finger. She kicked me and my son out, with no WiFi and knowing I don’t know anyone here, so we had to walk in the rain for 20 min. I have documents to prove all of this! She stole my money and then called me a liar because my son looks bigger than 7 years  old and told me I need to show her his passport to prove he is 7!!! Her behavior is inhuman, even her neighbors told me she is crazy. Normally I don’t like to write bad reviews but after being subjected to her cruel behavior with my son whom I get to visit once a year, I had to say something to get some sort of justice.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Old town is a big tourist attraction and from that stand point the location was great. Our family was not very happy with the unit for following reasons. Unit is on the ground floor which is generally for businesses. Air circulation was very bad so you have to keep windows open. As a result you can hear street conversations and they can look thorough open window. All bedrooms are in basement.  Though it has an element of being different, we had trouble adjusting. Air circulation was big issue  and it was not an ideal place to sleep. A cupboard door was broken and we ran out of toilet paper. All in all our family did not have a good time in the unit. Though location has great advantage, it was well below our expectation and not at all value for our money. Sorry for a bad review but I thought it is important to paint a realistic picture for future Airbnb guests so that they can make informed decision. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin och välplanerad lägenhet som passar bra även för längre vistelser för en person. Köket fullt utrustat, fräscht badrum och bekväm säng.\n\nBostadens läge är optimalt med korta promenadavstånd till allt man kan behöva och Karlaplans tunnelbanestation är endast ett par hundra meter bort.\n\nRekommenderas inte för personer med rörelsehinder då sängen är uppe på ett loft.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfect place to stay for our trip. The apartment is walking distance to the train which then goes into Stockholm. It’s about a 20 minute ride into the city which isn’t bad. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. Check in/out was also very easy. The host left us easy directions to follow. Definitely recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is lovely, furnished with all the needed basics, larger than appears in the pictures and surrounded by a beautiful forest with really good connections in terms of public transport to reach central Stockholm. The bed is very comfortable and shower’s also good. Possibly one of the most affordable options on Airbnb for a long-term stay in the city (my partner and I stayed for a full month) close to stunning nature.\n\nWhen it comes to minus points, we experienced quite heavy disturbances for two weeks straight coming from the upstairs neighbours (bad luck), which points to a larger issue: our host, owner of the upstairs apartment (and the whole building complex it seems) also hosting the disruptive guests, seemed somehow unwilling to step in to confront the neighbours about their violent/inappropriate behaviour and extremely loud noise. After a number of complaints (we got in touch to see whether we should call the police), we were basically told that given the thin walls of the complex, we were bound to hear what went on elsewhere in the building—so we ended up having to “suck it up”, meaning we spent two weeks being constantly woken up and random hours in the night by other Airbnb guests in the building, which obviously compromised our sleep. In conclusion: if you decide to rent this apartment looking for a relaxing getaway like we did, you may want to pray to the gods so you don’t have to live near such unpleasant or loud people (maybe you’ll be lucky, unlike us). On another note, we had to deep-clean the kitchen cabinets and surfaces ourselves when we checked in, and found used dental floss on the drawer of the bedside table, so cleanliness is another aspect to work with (although the majority of the apartment was okay). Overall a good place to stay, but some room for improvement in terms of communication and cleanliness.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>very bad experience. The landlord required us to check in after 6 p.m, so we went to dinner first and we arrived the flat after 7 p.m. It's dark outside at that time and we found the lights in the flat can't be turned on!!! We contacted the landlord in darkness and She said the light is broken and she's busy so she can't answer small questions like this! This is very bad and unpleasant experience. We booked the flat for 2 days, but we choose to move to hotel the second day because we don't want to ruin our trip!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice apartment and very clean. No bad surprises</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>A lovely room I'd like to stay for even longer time if I could. Some wrong information on Airbnb app caused a little bit of trouble but we figured it out. I would like to recommend Ewa's place for future travelers.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Comfortable stay. Location is good to start exploring Södermalm and Gamla Stan. Very good instuctions to find the place. Ewa is very friendly, you can feel like at home. The room is small, it's good or bad -  it's up to the needs, very comfortable bed. Every morning you'll get breakfast. The flat and the room are tidy and cosy. Will plan to stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Trevligt rum, rent i både rum och badrum. Bra kommunikationer. Trevligt värdskap.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I have had  a great time staying here! Will see you again hopefully !\n\nTo my future friends or To the world surfers  who want to travel to Sweden:\nIf you would like to be close to the heart of Stockholm, Sweden and close to everything you might imagine (Location Wise) OR if you want to have a peaceful stay in a soulful area and Great Host (Shahla)  DO NOT hesitate , I have had a great time with this host. Do not get me wrong, I am very OCD with a picky attitude and not trying to suck up on the host, if this host was rubbing me up wrong way I would been all over the place and  the first one broadcasting it not only in here but also on tweeter.\nDo yourself a favor and give a try with Shahla . You would not be regret . The location and her pricing is a Win-Win. \n\nThanks Shahla !!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin, öppen lägenhet! Känns hemtrevlig. Väldigt liten hiss, får t ex inte plats barnvagn eller mer än en resväska + person så får åka i omgångar (4 vån upp). Fräscht och rymligt kök, litet minus för avsaknad av mikrovågsugn. Helt okej sängar. Litet men funktionellt badrum, minus att ingen spegel fanns. Smidig utcheckning med möjlighet att ha kvar väskorna (vi flög hem kl 20) innanför dörren. Läget är kanon förutom att det är en hyfsat brant backe upp, men väldigt centralt! 10 min promenad från Arlanda Express bl a och en mängd restauranger inom 500 m.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayied in Pontus' apartment with my girlfriend and it was really comfortable. It's just like the pictures so everything was as we expected. The kitchen has everything one needs to cook and the bed and the couch were comfortable! The neighborhood was also good, filled with nice places where to eat and drink something after dinner. The only thing that annoyied us a bit was the bathroom because sometimes it smelled bad.\nAnyway i globally suggest this flat to every couple that want to visit the beautiful Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mysig lägenhet med superläge för alla barnfamiljer! Nära en stor lekplats, mysiga promenadvägar, utegym och strand med badplats. Under en kortare vistelse behöver man inte ens lämna Söder, men vill man det är det nära till både buss och tunnelbana. Sofia är serviceminded och svarar snabbt på meddelanden. Rekommenderas varmt!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Super ren lejlighed. Super central beliggenhed tæt på restauranter og lækker park med bademulighede. Sofia er meget hjælpsom.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The worst trip I had. The description says there are two bedrooms, which is wrong. There is only one bedroom, the sofa that is not expandable and not designed to sleep on it. At night we found out that there are not enough blankets and pillows. The host just said - you have two, but I can't imagine how to sleep two people on U shaped sofa with one blanket and one bedsheet. The host was aware of how many people are coming, confirmed the trip and didn't prepare the apartments. I definitely do not recommend to stay here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is located well ,near the harbor of ferry  to Tivoli,as well ,a walkable distance to many famous scences ,we do not need to drive car and can easy to play in the city centre\nWhen I  play on  Vasa Mesuem ,my bag is stolen ,many important things are lost,when I called  Jessica and told her the bad news ,she give me many empathy and offered me very important help,this really helped  me to solve the next problems,\nGood living place and warm host,Highly recommended｡</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bra lägenhet och mycket bra läge, nära affärer, restauranger, badstrand och promenadstråk. Rekommenderas!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vertinnen er imøtekommende og meget hjelpsom med både informasjon om området, transport og svarer raskt på meldinger. Hun var veldig forståelsesfull da flyet vårt var forsinket fredag kveld. Luftig, koselig leilighet med store rom. Lite bad, men hadde det vi trengte. Kjempekoselig liten balkong med flott utsikt mot byen! Verandadør som vi kunne ha åpen på natten, ingen støy fra gaten. Behagelig, rolig boligområde ved elven. Restauranter like ved, vi spiste på flere av dem i løpet av oppholdet. Wifi og TV, og vertinnen satte fram kaffe til oss da vi kom. Meget lettvint med flybuss, lett å finne fram. Praktisk med buss direkte mot den andre delen av Søder. Også mulig å gå helt til byen, via Mariatorget - som anbefales. Fornøyd! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mia´s lejlighed er lys, ren og med god beliggenhed i Stockholm i forhold til metro, indkøb og seværdigheder m.v. Lejligheden er iøvrigt med et dejligt badeværelse med badekar og et velfungerende køkken.\nSom en ekstra bonus havde Mia givet os en Champagne vi kunne nyde nytårsaften, en fin gestus fra hende.\nVi kan varmt anbefale andre at booke hendes lejlighed.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is nice and very well located. Good for a group.\n\nBut :\n\n- there is a bad smell in the bathroom / toilets.\n- Only one key is not enough for a big apartment like that. We were only 5 but it is already not enough when people want to do different things.\n- poor communication : Owner just told us she thought it was 2 keys and she sent somedy checking the smelling at a time I told her we were not here... so nobody was here for opening him the door... last day we ask for an important question, we still waiting for the answer...\n\nWith just a better communication, my valuation would be so better ! Even if solutions were not available, communication is important.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfect location, cosy apartment, not all amenities worked as expected and there was a really bad smell in one of the bathrooms.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We traveled to Stockholm with our 7 months old kid and we had a great stay, the apartment is very well situated, very clean and the host answers so fast. Stockholm is a great city that we discover in a very comfortable way thanks to L! \n\nThe only issue we had was the (no) wi-fi during our stay, but we arranged it going to the McDonalds, in a different travel it could be a very bad issue but not in this case. Thanks for all!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It was second time when we were at Maria’s apartment! it was amazing as usual! It is a big and well equipped apartment in the good area! Super cool kitchen and the most comfortable bad ever <3 \nIt’s  really nice and comfortable for couple :)  supermarket ICA(5 min walk), cafes, restaurants and everything what you need - very close to the apartment!\nIt is well located, 20 min walk to the city center (Gamla Stan)!\nMaria is a super host! She was super helpful and hospitable! Communication was great!\nEverything was amazing and i totally recommended to stay at Maria’s apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The house was really cute, just 10 minutes from the station. It was really well cleaned, and big. Nothing bad to say.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The was some good things and bad things about our stay in this apartment. The communication, location and assistance with baggage storage were great. The main complains are that the shower was not fixed after a previous guest had complained and the entire bathroom floor was flooded and towels were all wet on the floor. This made the showering progress very uncomfortable. There were also so evenings and mornings where there were no warm water. Just something to note is that the kitchen is super tiny and not suitable if you want to cook proper meals but its good enough for a quick meal.  \n\nOverall I would not recommend this apartment to another quest except if the shower is fixed then I would.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastisk beliggenhed, lækkert imdrettede opholds- og soverum og stort godt badeværelse.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Väldig charmig lägenhet med perfekt läge. Vacker inredning. Härligt stort badrum. Litet kök till mycket begränsad matlagning.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Många trappsteg upp till lägenheten, ingen hiss. Kodlås till port och dörr vilket underlättade vid ankomsten. Mysig lägenhet i två plan. Bilderna stämmer överens med verkligheten. Det finns endast ett badkar, ingen dusch. Ligger nära till det mesta. Skönt att slippa slutstäda, bara att knalla ut genom dörren på avresedagen. Kan rekommendera värdarna och lägenheten. Även fast det var lite dammigt och varmt på ovanvåningen så bor jag och min familj gärna här igen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I enjoyed my stay at Tommy's! He was super helpful and was always there to assist my queries and concerns, and Zelda was always there to provide the warmth and attention to the guests. \n\nThe location is a 10-15 minute walk away from the Central station and bus terminal, and there is also a bus stop nearby the apartment that can also take you to Gamla Stan (if you don't feel like taking the train or walking).\n\nThe apartment is really clean, the comfy bed and heated shower was always something I'd look forward going home to. \n\nIt was also nice that German family whom I shared spaces with (see listing for room types) also felt like family. I did feel bad having to cut through their room to mine (or vice versa to the toilet), but I think it soon became common understanding that we're all living in a shared space. :)\n\nThanks Tommy for making this place feel like home!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I didn't actually get to stay at Ruben's because I booked the BnB for the same day. I texted him to tell him that I need the place for tonight, in the afternoon. He accepted the request at midnight, after I had already found another place and the night was half gone. In my opinion, when he saw that the booking was for tonight and it's already 11pm, he shouldn't have accepted. He barely knows working English so that made the whole ordeal even more difficult, or perhaps even caused the misunderstanding in the first place. \nI am sure the BnB is comfortable and Ruben is a polite guy but my experience was bad.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The hosts were great and very responsive in a quick manner. Every question could be directed to them, and you'd have a response nearly as soon as you sent it. They work and live just around the corner, so they could have easily made an appearance if something were to go wrong in the place. The extra amenities (cable, mood lighting, etc.) really made the place worth the stay. Only thing I wish I had more of was time to explore more of the area around the apartment. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is Eric's apartment - he moves out while you're there, giving you free range of the place except for the bedroom. So you essentially camp out in the living room. No wardrobe/drawers for your clothes but there are hangers and hooks. The bunk bed is very high and I suspect most people don't use it. The sofa bed is okay but would not work for anyone with a sensitive / bad back.\n\nKitchen and bathroom are fine.\n\nThe location was fine for us though it's a little bit out of the tourist centre. A good neighbourhood though with good eating options and it's near a metro station and on good bus routes.\n\nTop marks to Eric who went out of his way to accommodate our early arrival, giving us an early check-in.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I wish I could give location and value an infinite amount of stars!! A friend and I stayed here and it was the perfect size. There is a single bed and a very large pull out couch which both were very comfortable! The apartment is also located right in the middle of the city, and we did not need to use public transport a single time. Walking was not only so easy and convenient but also absolutely stunning! Stockholm is truly a beautiful city with so much to see and do. We loved staying here and would stay here every single time we came back to Stockholm! Gabriella and her family were also the best hosts - very communicative, accommodating, and sweet. Highly recommend - you cannot go wrong with this one!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>During a week in Stockholm very nice and comfortable. Thanks for Sofia and her husband. We checked in smoothly in the afternoon. Her husband took lots of fresh fruits and Swedish milk from supermarket for us. It's very nice for us who had took a long way flight. He is a very kind and funny guy, show me the apartment how to work. And leaved me some presents which is so local--the Swedish air in the box. \nThanks so much and it's will let me miss here when I saw it in the future. \nThe apartment is very clean. It looks like just painted and almost everything (like the towels)are new. It is located in center Stockholm. The taxi driver who drived me here told me this area is a rich one so it's means very safety and no problem. That's true! Very peaceful no any noise! \nThe supermarket and some sushi bar and restaurant is around there by 3 min walk. \nVery convenient! \nThanks so much guys. \nWe had a nice time here even tough the bad weather. \nPlease keep it tidy and clean like your home! \nVery nice apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Everything was as expected. The added extras included outstanding hospitality, a well stocked bathroom, the welcome fizz. Great location to live like a local but so close to train (5minute walk) or city (easy 20 minute walk). You can’t go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Perfectly located apartment if you want to explore both sides of Stockholm. Rustic and quaint space, really can’t go wrong here if you want an authentic experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment was in a amazing location just minutes walk to the royal palace in Old Town Stockholm. The stairs weren’t as bad as other reviews make them seem to be. There is no railing but as long as you walk on the wider portion they weren’t too bad. It was nice being able to just use a lockbox to get the key. There is a grocery store down in the T station right next to the unit and some lovely cafes/restaurants nearby. It would have been good to know we could have them prearrange for us transit cards so we didn’t have to buy them ourselves, but you can get them at the shop just down the road. The communication was great and very quick if we had any questions while we were there.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>When we arrived, we thought what a lovely home this is. But the closer we looked, the worse it got. The bathroom door doesn't close, which is why we had to close the kitchen door everytime someone used the bathroom. When we asked Sofi about it, she said this occured before, but apparently she didn't care to fix it. \nWe planned to cook our own meals in the kitchen, but that was impossible, because, there was only one tiny (and dirty) pan - not enough to cook anything for three people.\nTwo beds werd okay, the third was so used up, it nearly hang to the ground. \nTo say somerhing positive: The check in and out was really easy and the location was perfect - right in the heart of Gamla Stan. \nIf you don't plan to cook, don't need privacy in the bathroom and pack flip flops for using the shower, then I can recommend the appartment of Sofi. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Small place in old area of Stockholm. Fine for one night. We didn’t like the ever present stink in the toilet it was really very strong, either the drains are bad there or something else needs fixing. It’s also right above a burger bar so you’ll also get the burger smells coming up from below.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A horrible experience.  Neither more nor less!  Fake flowers in the apartment could far from give the experience in this residence the necessary boost.  On the contrary.  They were perhaps the most honest accommodation offered to us.  The host claims to have had guests for 3 consecutive years.  In that case, without a service level!  The apartment appears cozy and without any sense to take care of the guest.  The bathroom has mold on the wall, there is dust on the walls and hair around the toilet.  The toilet is running, the water in the faucet must be used with care.  The hot water becomes scalding.  If other travelers use the water in the kitchen while bathing, it will be dangerous for the person taking a bath.  The temperature rises immediately.  A lot of noise from the fridge - around the clock.  The light in the kitchen is flashing so people with epileptic seizures are not advised to book this accommodation.  The TV didn't work either.  There are no or very bad clothing hangers.  I myself host and do not understand why the host does not get new ones.  It could not possibly be an expensive expense.  The radiator is either unbearably hot or cold.  It is not easy to set.  Like much else in this property, it should also get a service check.  Be aware that if you have any changes to the condition of the home, you must stay home!  The host demands you be present.  I had several things reported but expected a responsible host made sure to rectify my complaint points while experiencing Stockholm.  I definitely think one should consider another residence.  Definitely not worth the money.  The host did not respond to my inquiries for up to 15 hours.  Maybe offended, maybe indifferent.  On arrival we found it difficult to find the place, the host was impossible to contact.  Had to contact AIRBNB.  Also, did not receive that link for check-in until I made an inquiry at the time of check-in.  Think the host forgot this.  The area around Gamla Stand is a tourist trap, the experience of this booking was confirmed in this.\n\n\nEn hemsk upplevelse.  Varken mer eller mindre!  Falska blommor i lägenheten kan långt ifrån ge upplevelsen i detta boende det nödvändiga boostet.  Tvärtom.  De var kanske det mest ärliga boendet som erbjuds oss.  Värden påstår sig ha haft gäster i tre år i rad.  I så fall utan servicenivå!  Lägenheten verkar mysig och utan mening att ta hand om gästen.  Badrummet har mögel på väggen, det finns damm på väggarna och håret runt toaletten.  Toaletten går, vattnet i kranen måste användas med försiktighet.  Det heta vattnet blir brännande.  Om andra resenärer använder vattnet i köket under badet, kommer det att vara farligt för den som tar ett bad.  Temperaturen stiger omedelbart.  Mycket ljud från kylen - dygnet runt.  Ljuset i köket blinkar så att personer med epileptiska anfall inte rekommenderas att boka detta boende.  TV: n fungerade inte heller.  Det finns inga eller mycket dåliga klädhängare.  Jag är själv värd och förstår inte varför värden inte får nya.  Det kan inte vara en dyr kostnad.  Kylaren är antingen outhärdligt varm eller kall.  Det är inte lätt att ställa in.  Liksom mycket annat på den här fastigheten bör det också få en servicekontroll.  Var medveten om att om du har några ändringar i hemets skick måste du stanna hemma!  Värden kräver att du är närvarande.  Jag hade rapporterat flera saker men förväntade mig att en ansvarig värd skulle korrigera mina klagomål medan jag upplevde Stockholm  Jag tycker definitivt att man borde överväga en annan bostad.  Definitivt inte värt pengarna.  Värden svarade inte på mina förfrågningar i upp till 15 timmar.  Kanske förolämpad, kanske likgiltig.  Vid ankomsten fann vi det svårt att hitta platsen, värden var omöjlig att kontakta.  Var tvungen att kontakta AIRBNB.  Fick inte heller den länken för incheckning förrän jag gjorde en förfrågan vid incheckningen.  Tror att värden glömde det här.  Området runt Gamla Stand är en turistfälla, upplevelsen av denna bokning bekräftades i detta.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a wonderful stay at Elie and Judy. They are lovely hosts, always ready to help and always preoccupied if I needed anything. It was my first time using airbnb and I did not regret it. Elie and Judy's apartment is very nice and located near Alvsjo station, close to many means of transport that could take you to the city centre. To my view, a 10 star-experience, too bad the website allows you to rate on a scale from 1 to 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is great, clean, well equipped and has a great location, because downtown can be easily reached by public transportation.\nJust one thing was a bad surprise: Be warned not to park in the street in front of the house. We did not know that and got a ticket for 120 Euro (including fees) which made the stay there quite expensive.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Smidig checkning samt fint och bekvämt badrum och kök.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is extremely conveniently located. This is good.\n\nThe rest is pretty bad. The apartment is small, and the photos on the website do not match the reality. So if you are looking for a cozy, hygge feel that you see -- beware, there will be none. There was an empty apartment, not well cleaned (I had to clean the toilet and the shower myself), with used IKEA furniture instead. The bed is supersmall and fits 1 person only. There is couch and apparently there was a dusty inflatable bed dumped in the corner. \n\nIf you choose to stay in this place, do request the actual photos of the apartment beforehand to avoid any disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"I truly wish I could write a glowing review of Danty's place, because it really could have been the perfect stay, apart from some minor glitches, plus one rather considerable glitch, that, combined, made for an overall disappointment that resulted in me negotiating a refund with the co-host (which I still have yet to receive). Given all the positive reviews that came before, what could possibly have gone wrong? \n1) Upon arrival, I found out the bed was broken, and the host had nicely made up the pull-out bed instead. This might not seem like such a big deal, until you realize that the bed is really the most basic and essential thing when paying for accommodation. The co-host and I had been corresponding back and forth in the days and hours leading up to my arrival (he'd been very helpful about other things), but at no point did he feel it necessary to point out that the previous tenant had broken their bed to the point that it was no longer fit to be used, at all. I felt misled. I would have hoped he had informed me of this mishap so as to give me a fair chance to reconsider my booking and to find alternative accommodation without incurring any penalty charges. But he never gave me this chance.\n2) The apartment was dirty. The surfaces were dusty. There were visible food stains on some of the plates and dust on a lot of the glasses. The cooking utensils were sticky. I ran all the kitchenware through the dishwasher in batches (since the dishwasher was very small) and it took a good couple of hours.\n3) The host did not inform me that you need to book a time slot on a specific website in order to access the building's communal laundry machines. A friendly neighbour was kind enough to help me with this, after my third attempt to use the laundry facilities. \n4) The apartment listing states \"\"room darkening shades\"\" as one of the amenities. This is a joke. The grey curtains are of a thin</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Unieke ervaring op een luxe yacht met bubbelbad. Olle is gastvrij, super flexibel en reageert snel op berichten. \nEen echte aanrader voor een verblijf in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not recommended.  The apartment was with less crockeries, not provided with bath towels, shampoos, hand wash . These are the basic things which always should be in place. Other than that too unhygienic. Even we asked for room / air freshener . Crockeries was stinking with strong bad odour . From which my wife fell sick. Even to stay properly we have to clean the place & also cleaned when we left the place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>An apartment has just a bare minimum.  instructions are one page- long and about tv. it appears there are written not to allow to watch tv very confusing. we were not  able to turn it on. the kitchen has no windows blinds. it was impossible me to sit in the kitchen during the morning. it was two bright and hot. kitchen had only one frying pan and a tiny pot. there is no instruction about trash . no privacy.  at least one room   should have doors. it had a vert bad  drainage in the bathroom. after a small shower, the whole floor wa covered in a lots of water. the tub itself is very slippery.  it appears that an apartment in such great area of Stockholm is very cheaply organized.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Alex’s apartment is nice. It has everything we need. The location is not bad, close to the rainbow station, which is two stops from city centre. \n\nThe only thing we think need to be improved is the heat is not that hot. We covered two blanket when we sleep.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Een verblijf bij Anders is zéér aan te bevelen! Een mooi huis, met schitterende badkamer (inclusief sauna) en op slechts 8 minuten loopafstand van 2 metro stations. In 10 minuten ben je in het centrum, terwijl je je in het huis echt buiten de stad waant: heerlijk rustig en comfortabel. Anders is een geweldige gastheer: er stond een lunch klaar bij aankomst, hij gaf tips over bezienswaardigheden en had overal een oplossing voor! Bij ons volgende bezoek aan Stockholm boeken we zéker weer dit verblijf!!\nPetra</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We arriveerden midden in de nacht bij het appartement, moe van de vertraging van de vlucht kwamen we in een geweldig appartement, er waren drankjes en bier in de koelkast, brood in de vriezer, beleg, boter, fruit, koffie en thee, heerlijk dat je de volgende ochtend niet eerst boodschappen hoefde te doen. Het appartement is ruim, heel netjes en schoon, heeft een grote badkamer met sauna en is gezellig ingericht. Het ligt in een rustige wijk met allemaal van die leuke rode zweedse huizen, dichtbij zijn een aantal leuke eetgelegenheden en ook het metrostation is vlakbij, zodat je snel in het centrum van de stad kan komen. Er is een tuin bij het huis waar je heerlijk onder een appelboom kan zitten.\nAnders, de gastheer is erg behulpzaam en vriendelijk.\nBij een volgend bezoek aan Stockholm willen we hier zeker terugkomen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wij waren enorm tevreden over alle aspecten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Anders. \n\nNaar aanloop van onze trip naar Stockholm konden we via mail bij Anders altijd terecht met onze vragen. Hij reageerde telkens  zeer snel en vriendelijk. \n\nHet appartement voldeed volledig  aan onze verwachtingen die we hadden gesteld  op basis van de afbeelden op de website.\nHet appartement was zeer mooi en vooral kraaknet, zowel badkamer als keuken.  Anders had zelfs gezorgd voor een basisvoorraadje van fruit, koffie, een fles water, fruitsapjes, melk, kaas waardoor we ons echt welkom voelden. \n\nBij aankomst kregen we van Anders een rondleiding + enkele tips over Stockholm en verder konden we genieten van onze privacy met de boodschap dat we bij problemen altijd bij hem terecht konden. \n\nVia het appartement en de oprechte gastvrijheid van Anders  hebben we enorm  kunnen genieten van ons verblijf in Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Helt underbart. Vi var tre ungdomar som letade billigt boende i Stockholm för en festival som tog rum på Östermalm. Vi fann denna mysiga stuga och vi enades om att 25 kvadratmeter var lite litet men att det vore skönt att slippa hotell. Vi togs emot av två glada själar som gjorde allt för att vi skulle trivas så bra som möjligt. Stugan var mycket större än förväntat och badrum och kök gjorde det till en komplett lägenhet. Bra läge i ett fint grannområde och lättåtkomligt med kollektivtrafik från Centralstationen. Vi kunde inte blivit nöjdare.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The pictures make the space look a bit more bright and spacious than it is, but it is still an excellent studio apartment in a super ideal location. The only thing to note is the shower, which is a tiny little portion of the bathroom -- larger folks would likely have a problem with it. There is just a hanging curtain between the shower and the rest of the bathroom so it can get quite wet and soapy in there. I'm only 5' tall so it wasn't too bad :) We stayed for a week and were very busy, and it was a great crashpad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed at Adem’s during a family trip (4 peoples) for 4 nights. We never met Adem but we were warmly welcomed by one of his friends. The communication was very easy before and during our journey. The flat was perfectly located (allowing us to walk quickly to the city center) on a lively place. Also we had access to the pool which was a nice way to relax after a full day of visit. The weak points of the flat are the absence of window blinds and the fact that it is not meant to welcome 4 peoples: there are only 2 seats at the dinning table and the sofa bed was very (very) uncomfortable. In spite of having had bad nights, the overall journey at Adem’s flat was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First of all, the location of the apartment is superb - you can easily reach all tourist attractions both on foot and by bus and metro (both stations are 2-3 minutes from the apartment), the neighbourhood has many great restaurants and shops. There is also a big grocery store literally 20 m from the entrance, so it is very convenient. The apartment has an excellent view. Both the host and his friend, who let us in the apartment, were friendly and helpful. The apartment has all the basic things you might need - microwave, fridge, towels, etc. However, a few negative sides. If there are only two people staying in the apartment, it is great. The main bed is comfortable and there is enough space for everything. However, additional bed (either the couch or the air mattress) is not the best solution. The sofa isn't comfortable (it's lumpy and you can feel its metallic frame when you sit/lie) and the air mattress deflates as you sleep. It's not something you can't endure for a few nights, but if this problem was solved, the overall experience would be excellent. Also, if you are sensitive to light (especially if you travel in spring/summer), it wouldn't be bad to bring a face mask, since the morning light shines straight into the bedroom (around 4 am at the moment).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A pretty great place! It’s very big! As the other reviews have said there’s not a lot included so just expect that. I do also wish the bad had the option for a proper shower, but overall a great place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wonderful location and stylish compact apartment. Everything was extremely clean and the location makes exploring the old town so easy. We had arrived in Stockholm without our bikes - they didn’t make our flight - so we probably spent more time in the apartment than we expected waiting for them to be delivered but because of the apartment was so close to everything that wasn’t too bad. Tom was great to communicate with leading up to our visit and sent through so many helpful tips. we arrived a bit early but were able to leave our bags and wander. The kitchen was great for cooking. Wifi was fast and the bed was very comfortable ... though access can be a bit tricky if you need to go to the bathroom at night!! Staying there made our first visit to Stockholm very special.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Location's good. However, it's hard to communicate with the host. She gave me wrong instructions, so we had a really difficult time to find the room.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment was exactly as described.  The location was fantastic and made seeing the sights very easy.  Others have stated the directions were hard to follow, but if you do each part a step at a time it was very clear.  The description is very upfront about the restaurant downstairs, but I would add that if you are very sensitive to noise or smell this might not be the best fit for you.  Nothing was wrong with the smell, but the food being cooked does make it into the apartment.  Overall this was a great place to stay and perfect for our family of 4 for our visit to Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a great place to stay. It is perfectly located at the centre of Gamla Stan where you can easily access to stores and restaurants, and it is easy to walk to most of the tourists site on foot. The host is responsive and arranged for our early checkin which is very nice of her. The few things that bothers is that we need to walk up the stairs with our luggages, which is could be a little stressful but not a big deal. Moreover I do recommend you bring earplugs when you decide to stay here, the bass sound from the bar nearby is so loud which do bothers us at night so even though we had our earplugs on we could still feel it. Overall it was not a bad choice for us to stay here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is in the heart of Gamla Stan. Location is amazing. Subway stop is 8 min walking distance. The host was very slow with responses. Need to lift the luggage through stairs to bring it to appartment. The trash room downstairs is smelling very badly while passing to appartment. The night club at the bottom is pretty loud on weekends. The toilet doesn’t have heating floor.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sofie og Anders hjem er en oplevelse at bo i. De har stort talent for indretning og farver. Huset har mange sovepladser, to gode badeværelser og et velfungerende køkken. Der er en smuk udsigt fra husets terrasser og vinduer. \nHuset ligger ganske tæt ved Skogskyrkegården, men lidt besværligt i forhold til offentlig transport til Stockholm City. \nSofie er en venlig og serviceminded vært.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kerstin’s place is incredible. The space is so stylish and has everything that you need for a pleasant stay. The location was better than expected, in a great location to explore the entire city. I don’t have one bad word to say about our stay - it was fabulous!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice place in all aspects except badly equipped kitchen.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Fantastic location, great price, great place. Cant go wrong. Will stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Perfect location, lovely flat, very helpful and friendly hosts. You can’t go wrong staying here, I highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Erik is friendly and accommodating. Make sure to confirm the address with him because the AirBnB directions took me to the wrong address could have saved me 15 minutes of extra walking. The location can't be beat to get anywhere in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Good location, not great but not bad apartment, looked better in the pictures.  Even though the windows were closed the whole time, there were lots of tinny annoying bugs making it difficult to sleep.  Flexible check in, not so much for check out.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment is nice and very clean. The location is excellent. Unfortunately, the check-in was stressful. We received the wrong code to the key box to begin with, and we had to contact Airbnb as we couldn't reach the host directly. Luckily finally we got the correct code from the host and could access the flat - so it all worked out and the stay in the flat was good.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bra läge men lite oljud från restauranger i närheten men det får man väl räkna med när man bor så centralt. Rent och snyggt men några saker att anmärka på i badrummen. Mycket bra sällskapsutrymmen då vi var 6  st.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lovely flat to stay in and situated in a lovely area. Ignore the bad review.\n\nHost was a little slow to reply to messages so I was a little worried but all turned out fine and I was impressed with the place. Spacious and comfortable. \n\nHost isn't keen on 4 adults staying there though, so should point that out. There is more than enough room for 4 adults (1 king size bed, 1 single bed and 1 large sofa) but host had an issue with there being 4 adults because of the neighbours. He also asked us to lie to the neighbours about why we were staying there. That felt a little weird. \n\nGreat stay though in the end.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This flat was perfect!! Looks great, stylish yet super comfortable! Only a one bad flat but the air bed is Amazing. We traveled there as three girls and it’s was the perfect base. The location is superb! In the hub of sodermalm with everything on your door step! Check out Pascals caffe (best cinnamon buns) , urban deli and Pom & Flora!!! But there are still so many cool places to choose from which are stones throw away from the flat. \nThe place was clean , had all amenities you need for your stay.. \n\nOverall super happy !</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Johan and Henrietta’s place was perfect, you can’t go wrong staying here. I’ll definitely come back again when I’m in Stockholm. It was so clean, very quiet, such cool decorations. The location is great too, close to tons of cafe’s, restaurants, and entertainment venues at night. They were very responsive and very nice to work with</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>So bad</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi är supernöjda! Rent och fräscht.  Vi blev varmt välkomnade av Ninas man Fred.  Bästa läget! Vi hade allt vi behövde i lägenheten, diskmaskin, wifi, tvättmaskin och torktumlare, tv. OBS ! 3 trappor upp utan hiss kan vara värt att veta.  Vi kan varmt rekomendera både värden och lägenheten. Det kändes superlyxigt att bo så centralt i Gamla stan. Mataffär finns nära lägenheten och mängder med mysiga matställen. Fräscht badrum och kök. Perfekt för 4-5 personer, men man kan bo fler här utan problem.   Tack Fred och Nina.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>I came to Sweden with my parents for traveling. We love the city, however, the living experience was really disappointing. The apartment is really far away from the city center, so we have to pay for metro come and back every day which is a lot. Also, the apartment is kinda far from the metro station with uphills which is not really good for elders.  When we enter into the apartment, it’s very hot and with very basic equipments. So if ur here just for travel quickly, then it might be ok. However, if you want to enjoy life, feel like a home, then it’s definitely NOT. Every morning around 3:30am, the sun rises and the curtains are worse than useless, it’s really bright, so we were not able to sleep. Also, the WiFi signal was really really poor and unstable. Anyway, I think if we come to Stockholm again, we will definitely book a place in the city center, the price is not much difference, and it would be much easier.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was clean and well renovated. We really liked the new kitchen with the good equipment. The metro station is only a few walking minutes away but the snow clearing was really bad during our stay in January. The public sidewalk to the metro station was covered in ice over all four days we stayed there. So I cannot make a recommendation for elderly persons or other persons with reduced mobility during the winter months.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Det blev en trevlig vistelse på detta lilla hemtrevliga hotell i ett mysigt och tyst område i Stockholm. Hotellet består av 7 rum med gemensamma badrum och toaletter. Sänglinne och badlakan ingår och allt är rent och snyggt. Ett extra plus för skina sängar och gudomliga täcken och kuddar. Det som stack ut extra mycket var den enkla incheckningen och den perfekta frukosten! Mysigt område vid Mariatorget nära restauranger, butiker och tunnelbana. Prisvärt hotell som jag varmt rekommenderar om man inte eftersöker lyx och extra service! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket trevligt ställe med sköna sängar, fräscha badrum och en mycket bra frukostbuffé. Läget är perfekt med ca 5 minuters promenad till mariatorgets t-bana. Kommer garanterat stanna här igen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Pro: spacious, clean, good locaion\nCon: many stairs (4th floor by American standard, although informed 2nd), disordered thermostat in showroom, bad smell from downstairs, insufficient hot water, not well funtioning vacuum (although required to keep clean), insufficient shades (particularly no shades in  bathroom)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fredrick has been precise and kind to every requests. The apartment is small and functional perfect for couple. Fredrick also let us use Netflix for a bad  weather night. Nearby you can take the metro or public bike. We will recommend. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This apartment is really small but it's okay for two people. \n\nThe best thing about this apartment is the location. It's really close to cafes and bars (though they aren't always open) and a supermarket. Also super close to the metro train station which was brilliant. \n\nAlthough it says there's a kitchen, there are several things missing. There's no oven, mugs or a toaster. It would have been nice to know this in advance. \n\nIt was also disappointing that there was something wrong with a joint in the large shower head. Water sprayed out of the pipe and we were left using a small hand held head that had incorrect fittings to the wall so we had to hold it. \n\nWe also had an incident where the host/cleaner came into the apartment without letting us know in advance. They came in to replace a broken microwave. We feel this is unfair and rude and that we deserve to be told in advance so that we can ensure our belongings are secured safely. While we appreciate having the microwave replaced, we were disturbed that they thought it's okay to come in without letting us know. We are paying for the privacy and luxury of an airbnb and don't believe that we got it. \n\nNot sure that we recommend this place, but if you do stay here just be careful.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Such a beautiful apartment and so close to the old town and to stroll into parts of södermalm. The apartment is really well equipped and has a lovely little sunny balcony. Maja is a great host and even let us check in early and leave later on the day. The only thing which was bad was that it smelt a little with drain but after running water it was fine and didn't really bother us at all. Would definitely stay here again!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed for two nights around New Year's and can fully recommend Kristofer's place. The location was perfect for access from the Viking Line terminal, metro, and nice cafes (not to mention hours of toddler entertainment at the impressive Eriksdalsbadet, walkable from the apartment). The apartment was clean and comfortable, and Kristofer is a welcoming and helpful host. He helped us out with his flexibility on our check-in, and we appreciated how he stopped by to check in to see if all was well. Good place all around!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Björn bor i ett fint område med härlig natur och badställen och nära till tunnelbanan. Vi kommer gärna tillbaka.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is ok, just a few minutes to the metro. There is only one bathroom for the three rooms to rent. Don't respect 10 pm for silence.  The fridge and freezer are  dirty. In the bathroom smells bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Supermysig ombonad lägenhet med retrokänsla. Rent och praktiskt och lagom för 1-3 gäster. Jag bodde här själv i två nätter då jag jobbade i Stockholm. Jag trivdes bra och sov gott! Fantastiskt område med restauranger, affär, tunnelbana och pendeltåg runt hörnet.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Excellent location in Normmalm, but still quiet and relaxing. Great service: they were happy to store my bags and were generous in immediately restoring my electricity when I shorted my room's power with the wrong plug. Recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stort hus med gott om plats. Lummig trädgård. Området är mycket lugnt och tyst. Det är lätt att ta sig runt med allmänna kommunikationer; vi var två familjer med totalt fem barn utan bilar och det var inga problem. Nära till en bra insjö med fin badplats. Vi är mycket nöjda med vår vecka i huset!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastic location in a lovely city, the flat is full of character and an absolute delight, Would definitely recommend to friends at the price we rented it for. \n\nOn the down side the agency used is completely inflexible to the terms that are stated on airbnb which is fair enough as at least they do say but don't ask to drop your bags off or turn up earlier than they ask, even if you've a toddler and a pregnant partner as they have agreements with cleaning contractors, etc... It's also not worth asking for any advice as they just replied with some very unhelpful information. The agency also badgered me for an exact arrival time when i'd already given them a very small window. Once the agency were out of the way, we really enjoyed our stay.\n\nTop tip: Hired car from airport and parked it in one of the garages over the weekend (Fri to Sun), which was cheaper than hiring it from within Stockholm itself.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We had issues with check in (received the wrong code to the lock box in the pre received letter), and got a little annoyed having to stand outside the apartment door waiting for someone to call us back. After that initial mishap everything was great however! Perfect little apartment with walking distance to everything (pretty much). Great to be in the middle of the city (between Södermalm and Östermalm).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment right in the middle of Gamla Stan, is wonderful! close to the metro and central station, close to the shopping streets of Norrmalm, close to Slussen/Sodermalm... The apartment is really cosy, good for 4 people, easy to reach and easy checkin (if you follow the dealer rules). It has a kitchen with enough utensils and other kitchenware. Bathroom is quite small but fine. The dining/living room is really confortable (sofa-bed is comfortable). And finally the double bed room is also cozy. \nWe felt like a privilege staying there...and defenitely would stay there in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, cleanning could be better (even though it was not dirty either).\nBefore getting to the place, the host will send you one million comunications with the million rules...you'll feel a little overwhelmed but if you read what they say, it's only common sense stuff, so it is not too bad.\nWe did not like you can not check in until 17h unless you pay for more money.\nAnd the worst thing (even though it was not too bad) is that from thursday to saturday you can hear the music of the pub around the corner, even though our stay was in january and windows were closed. The pub closed soon those days (around 23.30h). I would recommend the property to complain about this situation to the municipality.\n\nBut even these not-as-good things, we had an excellent stay in there!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a lovely apartment with an neat, old-fashioned vibe in the Old Town part of Stockholm. The space seems to be managed by a third party company rather than an individual directly, so it was not surprising to us that communication was fast and detailed. This also meant that the place felt a little less personal as compared to some other AirBnbs at which we have stayed (no personal recommendations for the area or a sense of the apartment being lived in, for example), but this was largely fine for our single night stay. We were four people (two couples) and we fit comfortably on the double bed and sleeper sofa. \n\nThere were a few things which made our stay less than ideal, including lackluster towels/sheets, a slightly dirty bathroom, and a party next door which kept us up past 3am (we were there on a Saturday night, so perhaps this is something to look out for on the weekends).\n\nThis is by no means a bad place to stay and I would definitely recommend it to a friend if only for the coziness of waking up in Gamla Stan to walk the narrow streets before the rest of the tourists have flooded in! Thanks to the hosts!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket fin lägenhet med toppläge om man inte är kräsen av sig vad gäller badrum (det var minimalt). Tyvärr är In- och utcheckningstiderna MYCKET snålt tilltagna 17.00 in och 10.00 ut. Annars funkar allt mycket bra och vi trivdes i lägenheten.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Ida's place is lovely! The location couldn't be better for a convenient and stylish stay in the Old Town of Stockholm. Just steps from the T and the ferry to Djurgarden as well as wonderful shopping and sites out your front door. The shower is amazing and the beds were so comfortable. You can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The flat is clean but the building do not have any lift so you may need to carry you luggage for 2 floor. \nThe worst thing is The host didn't answer any message or phone call! NEVER!!! Even they said you can message them to request an earlier check in or keep baggage service after visit.\nThe check-in guideline is not that clear, the communication is ready bad. \nDisappointed!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sentralt,  romslig leilighet. \nLitt upersonlig, men hyggelig sted å bo. Bråkete vifte på kjøkkenet, men man lukker bare døren. Inngang mellom to utesteder, men stillere enn forventet om natten, jeg kunne ha åpent vindu. Nytt bad, god seng, hard sovesofa. Fint opphold\nAnbefaler bakeriet på Järntorget, og Stadsmisjonens fantastiske kafé ved Storkyketorget.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het appartement staat op een toplocatie midden in Gamla Stan \nHet appartement is erg mooi en hebben een prima verblijf gehad. Enige minpuntje de badkamer die een vervelende geur heeft.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had an amazing stay at the appartement and would definitely come back! Everything was clean and no bad suprises. Especially the location is what makes this appartement so perfect. A lot of nice bars and restaurants are arround and you can easily get to other places. We also felt really safe and overall had an amazing stay. The host was always available and texted back immeadiatly. Thanks for everything!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sikke et hyggeligt og dejligt hjem! Beliggenheden er rigtig god - roligt kvarter, tæt på dejlig badesø og indkøb og med kun 15 min. til Stockholm centrum via letbane/tog. Alt fungerede perfekt, og huset var skinnende rent og indbydende. Gode senge, veludstyret køkken og bare super hyggeligt. Katten Zorro kommer trofast og spiser hver morgen og er virkelig sød og kælen - for os et hyggeligt plus. Kommunikationen har været upåklagelig med hurtige svar og masser af gode tips. Vi har følt os meget velkomne og kan varmt anbefale Johan som vært og ikke mindst hans dejlige hjem.\nHilsen familien Eriksen fra Danmark </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Look no further if you want the perfect place to stay in Stockholm. If you think you want a hotel or another place, you’re wrong. This apartment is centrally located in the Gamla Stan or “Old Town”. Being able to walk anywhere within a 30 minute walk and covering almost everything that there is to see. There was a metro within a 5 minute walk from where we were staying! Everything was clean and there were plenty of necessities that Charlotta had prepared for us when we got there. Don’t look any further if you want an incredible stay in the heart of Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Marlena responds to requests and messages at the very minute. Her place is extremely clean. Also easy to access as only like 20 min from T-Central Stockholm downtown by subway. She is so hospitable and polite. She also showed a very nice understanding to my last minute change request as I booked for the wrong day! I felt very welcomed and definitely suggest her as a host and her place to stay. Thank you Marlena!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is bad, if u a with lagguges u need to order taxi from aiport, because by train, metro it's very hard to move, and close by flat there is the bridge which u need to cross, but the host didn't tell about that, just note that</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Det var verkligen trevligt att bo i Katrins lägenhet. Både i den stora sängen i sovrommet och på soffan i vardagsrummet sovde vi utmärkt. I köket hittade vi allt vi behövde. Vi tyckte särskilt om det stora badrummet, den mysiga balkongen där vi brukade äta frukost med lite morgonsol och tv samt Netflix och mycket mera. Hammarby sjöstad är ett jättefint område att bo i. Med båten är det helt enkelt att ta sig över till Södermalm, och så finns det spårvagnen en stenkast från huset. Katrin svararde snabbt på alla våra frågor. Kort sagt: Kan bara rekommenderas!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi var 4 venner som leide leiligheten over 3 overnattinger. Veldig fin leilighet i nærheten av alt hva man behøver. Cafeer, restauranter og fine butikker i nærområdet - veldig sentralt til alt. Niklas var hyggelig vert og fleksibel på både innsjekking og utsjekkingstidspunkt. Stor og koselig leilighet med alt av utstyr man trenger. Eneste minus var veldig lite bad, men det er vel vanlig for eldre leiligheter i storbyen :) Vil absolutt leid leiligheten på ny ved neste Stockholmstur. Takk for oss! :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice friendly hostess. Good ratio quality/price for Stockholm. Convenient location esp for business journey. Sufficient quality of bad, bath and kitchen applience. Highly recommended</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"En supermysig vindsvåning i underbar miljö i Gamla Stan. Vilket fönster man än tittade ut igenom så var det en slående utsikt av gamla fina takåsar och Tyska Kyrkans torn i bästa blickfång från fönstren på övre plan i lägenheten. Fantastiskt fint!\nJättesköna sängar! Många kuddar att välja bland - titta i den generösa Walk In Closet:en på nedervåningen. Rent och fräscht överallt. En portabel fläkt fanns som är bra när man är i övergångsåldern ;-)\nGillade också den stora härliga byrån i sovrummet på nedervåningen som hade en liten vacker marmorskiva ovanpå där man kunde lägga fram sina smycken. Den tänker jag ta efter - kändes lyxigt! Väldigt rymligt överallt om man tex vill ha en resväska liggandes framme på golvet. Ordentliga mörkläggnings-rullgardiner i sovrummen. Fönstren gick lätt att öppna och stänga så man kunde få ett friskt korsdrag. Sobert inrett, ljust och fräscht med fina detaljer. Till 95% allt från IKEA - jag har koll på det ;-) \n\nEtt litet minus är att det endast finns ETT badrum/toa - ganska så trixigt om man är fyra vuxna som är van med det dubbla. Blev lätt köbildning.....\nÄr även väldigt lyhört - man hörde tex tydligt grannarna äta mat.\nDetta är också något som Hedvig informerar om vid incheckningen - att vi som gäst måste tänka på, att hålla låg ton i respekt till de boende. Det är VÄLDIGT lyhört men var absolut inget som störde OSS - men tänk på det - att allt ni säger och gör HÖRS verkligen!\nOch som tidigare resenärer beskrivit så är det alltså fyra riktigt jobbiga trappor upp till lägenheten, ingen hiss! Bara så att man är medveten om det. \n\nHedvig har varit en FANTASTISK värdinna från start till mål. Hon har verkligen levt upp till \"\"24/7\"\"-tillgänglighet. Det hade hon verkligen inte behövt för VÅR skull</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The good-\nThis place is adorable, comfortable, conveniently located, and decently stocked. Communication was easy and messages were responded to quickly. \n\nThe not great-\nHad some issues getting the washer/dryer to work. Luckily they answer messages quickly and had someone come to fix it, however it takes a very long time to dry. Also, you are limited to one towel the whole time, so if you have long hair, you need to ask for more. We wound up taking more because the bathroom floods when you shower.\n\nThe bad- \nThe shower floods the bathroom pretty badly, we had to use extra towels just to dry the floor after.\nWhen I booked they asked me to upload my government ID to Airbnb, not an issue, but then\nthey asked me to upload my husband's as well, I told them he didn't have an Airbnb account so they asked me to share it with them. I told them I was uncomfortable with this and they dropped it, but it still was kind of weird exchange and one I hadnt been asked for before on Airbnb.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Caution - the worst smell, ever, from the bathroom. The host reports it as “being an old building” but my boyfriend and I quite literally used public restrooms instead of his. The smell was so bad from pipes and it ruined the experience. That, combined with dirty stained sheets and pillows, dirty dishes, and a weird hodgepodge of items made it uncomfortable. To continue, there’s NO window and NO ventilation. The only option is to open the door in freezing temperatures. It gets so stuffy so fast, and that combined with the bathroom smell makes you sick. Additionally, there’s almost no ease of using things. For example, he allows you to use 2 towels (for two people) before you pay extra. For towels? To clean? The towels given are truly worse than gym towels and stay wet and hurt your skin. He also limits sheets and pillow case usage, which seems.. odd? \n\nAny concerns we had to the host were responded to with a canned response from some member of his “team” a different one each time. Extremely fishy and makes you wonder whats happening.\n\nAnyways, so much went wrong but a little went right. Check in is very easy and the location is superb. Truly in the heart of Gamla Stan (old town) and is a gem.\n\n\nsummary - dirty, smelly, host is unresponsive, ridiculous rules, but a good location. Even with that, please stay away.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Läget och priset är det som är det bästa med detta boendet. Promenadavstånd till allt. Vi var två vuxna och två barn (6 och 9 år) som bodde här och det var fullt tillräcklig yta. ”Dubbelsängen” är smal men det var bara lite mysigt! \n\nLite ”kloak-lukt” från badrummet men dåligt fall från duschen ihop med äldre hus bidrar nog. Det var i alla fall inte något som vi lade någon större vikt vid. \nRekommenderar verkligen detta stället!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We checked in very late in the evening, but nevertheless Renée opened the door with a smile and made us feel very welcome. One of the nice extra and considerate touches was a bottle of wine waiting for us and a treat for the children. The house is modern, yet cozy and spacious. Lovely garden with large diningtables on both sides of the house. During our stay the children enjoyed the inflatable pool outside, aswell as a huge amount of toys. We had access to all necessities and more. The beach 'Kanaanbadet' is very popular and busy and approximately 15 minutes away by car. If you wish to go swimming in more peace and quiet, we recommend to go to 'Ljunglöfska slottet'. 'Vällingby centrum' is close by, which includes a shopping mall and all sorts of stores. In Vällingby you can park your car for 20 SEK a day and take the underground to Stockholm city, which only takes about 25 minutes. We had a great stay at Renée's and Jocke's house and would definitely consider renting it again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What can I say about Karåla and her family? They made me feel at home from the moment I arrived, we had great conversations and I learned a lot about Sweden with them, this all made me enjoy Stockholm even more.  I would definitely go back or maybe I will want to stay in their Airbnb in Spain, it would not be bad!  Anyway, totally recommended!  Great days to remember :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is not bad, reachable by metro and then walking/bus. Grocery shop is near metro station. Apartment is quite nice in overall. \nBiggest issue we had: it was very cold inside, despite the radiators on max level.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Alber was a lovely host, in a wonderful space, just what we needed for the night and he did everything he could to accommodate us even when things went wrong like our flight getting delayed and not getting there till late</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This large private home with ALL the amenities was absolutely stunning. It easily accommodated our traveling party of 5 with each person getting there own room. Beds were VERY comfy. It was very quiet and peaceful. This large penthouse was right where all the great restaurants (we never had a bad meal or snack), coffee shops, historical sites and the Nobel Museum is located. It’s a skip of a walk the other way to the Ferry which takes you over to all the little islands. You can see the amusement park Grona Lund from the ferry side. We walked, scootered and Segwayed all over Sodermalm, Gamla Stan and Hornstull to site-see and shop. Original art work galleries located everywhere with SO much variety. The hosts were very informative, kind and hospitable.  We would most definitely stay here again.  Thank you for helping us make great memories with our families!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is located in the hip area of Hornstulls, with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It was especially close to the local train stop. They gave detailed check in/out instructions so everything was seamless. The space is really cozy and restroom is pretty small, but we were basically only there to sleep and get ready in the morning. We were too busy enjoying beautiful  Stockholm anyway :)  We were blessed with good weather in Sept, so we biked everywhere and loved it. There is a park close by that has a little beach area (Tanto strandbad), that I’d also recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very nice, clean and priceworthy place to stay. Me, my boyfriend and our 9-month old son stayed with Gabriela during a very warm weekend in August (Fri-Sun) so the room was hot when we arrived and in the evening but got cool during night with the window opened (she tried to find a fan but they were sold out). Both a baby chair (Stokke) and a BabyBjörn babysitter was available in the apartment - not what we expected beforehand but a nice detail even though we brought our own baby chair. A room for strollers 'barnvagnsrum' with great space, available inside the house entrance - we used this opportunity as well. Lovely woman with two beautiful daughters, also easy to cope with. Good communication, our questions got answered quickly. Keys were easy acessable at arrival even though Gabriela wasn't home yet for a couple of hours. I was there to play a rugby tournament at Skarpnäck Sportfält and it would've been ok walking distance but we drove. Parking outside the house, pay with the app 'Betala P' until 19.00 weekdays, free of charge weekends. We had our own shelf in the refrigerator. I even got to borrow the washing machine (for free) for my smelly training gear after day 1 of playing. The apartment is on the 2nd floor so some stairs to climb - no elevator - maybe not for guests with joint problems or disability. 5-10 min walk to Coop/ICA/pizzeria/grill and Bagarmossen metro station. Only 'complaint' with our stay was too soft pillows, but nothing really bad with this accommodation.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi var hos Cecilia tre dage,(mig og min mand) hun er meget sød og tålmulight og hjælper med alle forskellige spørsmål,\nHendes lejlighed har dejlig område og perfekt for gåture og tæt på vand og fantastik udsigt , tæt på centrum ,busstop og metro er også tæt på hendes lejlighed ,, Ind i lejligheden er perfekt og stille og soveværelset med romantik dekoration,og meget ren.Man kan godt se mange flotte planter i hele lejlighed,og man kan også bruge køkkenet.\nKøkken og badeværelse er også meget ren.\nVi vil meget gerne komme i en anden gang hos hende.\ndet er nemt at kontakte med hende.Hun svarer hurtigt.\nTak for den gang Cecilia</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice location, very quiet and an easy walk to lots of shops,  The two nearby restaurants where I ate were very good.   The four flights of stairs were not bad after I got used to them.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We could not have asked for a better experience. The location was perfect and incredibly convenient. William left so many tips too; it was very helpful. His apartment was BEAUTIFUL and so clean and aesthetically pleasing. We had several family members checking in and out and William was so accommodating.  We HIGHLY recommend William’s apartment.  It’s too bad we can’t give it more than 5 stars because it was perfect. I can’t wait to return to his place and to Stockholm!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Om ni vill bo i en rymlig, modern och fräsch lägenhet så är detta stället för er. \n\nKarin är en mycket bra värd och lägenheten ligger väldigt bra, lugn och skön miljö och bra kommunikationer samt nära till bad. Mataffär och restauranger ligger på promenadavstånd från lägenheten (eller två stopp bort med bussen). \n\nVi rekommenderar detta boende varmt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Karin tok kontakt med oss før vi skulle komme og vi avtalte hvor nøkkelen skulle overleveres. Vi fikk nøkkelen med tips til hvordan vi skulle komme oss til leiligheten. Det var lett å komme seg til leiligheten. Leiligheten var upåklagelig! Det var rent og ryddig. God standar, fine balkonger og uteområde. To bad var fantastisk bår vi var 3 voksne, 2 barn og en baby. Vi fikk tips til spiseplasser, wifi kode og mer. Hvis vi hadde spørsmål fikk vi raskt svar. Som førstegangs Airbnb’ere gav dette mersmak! Kan absolutt anbefale Karin’s leilighet!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is great, unfortunatly the kitchen is in bad shape</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>DON’T BOOK HERE!! \n\nWorst ever! The advertice says ”free parking” but that doesn’t exist. The check-in was late, when we arrived we couldn’t check in. The toilet did not work. Above that the host was really unkind and rude. \n\nWe had to leave, it was just to bad. Save yourself the problems and book somewere else!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Beautiful space, excellent location. Sophie was really helpful in giving us tips for what to explore. And a wonderful host, left us some wine and chocolate :) The only recommendation would be to update address, we were dropped of at wrong place!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stort charmigt hus, nära kommunikationer. Vackert läge i lugnt område. Nära till bad.\nRekommenderas på det varmaste!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wir waren 14 Tage in Stockholm und haben die Zeit dort sehr genossen. Das Haus ist sehr geschmackvoll und komfortabel eingerichtet. Es liegt ruhig neben einem Wald, so dass wir gelegentlich sogar Rehe neben dem Gartenzaun beobachten konnten. Man ist in 5 Minuten am Wasser, ein schönes Strandbad ist zu Fuß innerhalb von einer halben Stunde zu erreichen. Der Ort Äppelviken ist ebenfalls sehr beschaulich und besteht zum großen Teil aus bunten Holzhäuschen. \nDie City erreicht man bequem und in kurzer Zeit mit der Tunnelbahn (etwa 20 min). So bietet die Unterkunft den perfekten Ausgangspunkt, um sich in der Natur zu erholen und die Stadt zu erkunden. \nDie Kommunikation mit Helene verlief sehr gut. \nDanke noch einmal für eine tolle Zeit!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lovely space! Clean and beautiful apartment. Linda was eager to give recommendations and truly offered her home and her hospitality. Within a 10 minute walk of public transit and I never felt unsafe. Nothing bad to say about Linda or her apartment! (Except the caviar in a tube. Haha. ;) ) I would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It might be OK for the money you pay but I would definitely pay more and get a better (cleaner) place.\nI wouldn’t recommend this place for a solo girl traveller.\nThe host is really a nice guy but the place is really bad. It stinks (I mean literally).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Mycket trevlig lägenhet med närhet till tunnelbana och affärer i Hammarby desutom två badrum och två uteplatser.  Mycket trevligt mottagande av värdinnan och även lätt att komma ikontakt med vid behov. Vi är jättenöjda.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Its a nice apartment. For outsiders just be careful with the location. When i spoke to the local storekeepers , they kinda scared me about this part pf Stockholm. Hacking said this I didn’t face any bad experience honestly. Danijela was very sweet to us, she literally guided everything over the phone. Overall it was value for the money you pay. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Beautiful apartment, great location, clean, easy check in. Some noise from bars downstairs but nothing to bad. Would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lovely place in a great location, sadly the apartment toilet smelled bad (drainage problem possibly) and the instructions to get in were a little wobbly.. That said, the place was spotless and amazing for a group of one, two or 6 people.. Excellent location in Gamla Stan.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>expect nothing - than you cant get disapointed .. here goes everything wrong... dont book... each hostel in town is better ..</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Susanna and Jonas' place was perfect for our weekend stay in Stockholm. Really easy to get to from the Central station and located in a lovely area, close to Oxhalsbadet for a swim! It was easy to find and not far away from the bus stop. \n\nThe place itself is tastefully furnished and clean, no Wifi but the kitchen is well equipped (could do with some more utensils). The area is quiet and we slept well! Communication was very good and we were met at the door by Jonas who is pleasant and speaks good English.\n\nWould recommend and stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Susanna’s place was great - nice little flat in a quiet neighbourhood,  with easy access to central Stockholm. We were in the middle of nature and even saw a deer in the garden one morning! We also enjoyed having a morning swim at Oxhålsbadet - would definitely recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place, clean and warm! Not bad too in terms of location, about 10 mins or less to walk to the nearest tram station and you can basically get to central of stockholm or Gamla Stan quick easily and quickly. Overall, a really nice stay, would recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Centralt men ändå småstadskänsla. Bra kommunikation, bra bad på ön.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>There was a big and weird white stain on the blanket and pillows also look a bit dirty. The place was same as the pictures and nice, but we couldn't think of sleeping on the bed after seeing them and ended up leaving the place at night. I respecfully described the bad experience to the host and asked him to care more about cleaning for next guests, but it was really disappointing that he just said there had been no other guest who complained about that before. But I was complaing about what actually happened, and I think the host should've been more responsible for a guest's bad experience because I didn't pay for the stay on a dirty bed that I can see someone's mark. Sorry for leaving a bad review, but this is my experience in this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Här fick vi uppleva äkta Dala miljö med gammelstuga från 1700 tal \nmen också bekvämligheter från nutid!  Det mysiga ock unika boendet med möbler ock inredning från gången tid....naturen\nsamt badet vid Orsasjön!\nZornmuseet. Dalahäst tillverkningen\nBjörnparken... utflykten till storslagna Tällberg!\nAllt gör att vi vill fira jul ock nyår i denna mysiga dalamiljö!\nStrålande upplevelse! Tack!\n</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Huset er sjarmerende og med stort potensiale. Det er dog betydelig mer slitt enn man får inntrykk av på bildene. Det ligger nært butikk og bussholdeplass som korresponderer greit med tog og bane til bykjernen. For oss som var 11 kollegaer på tur var det en stor ulempe at det ikke er dør inn til flere av soverommene. Dette burde kommet tydelig frem i beskrivelsen. Dog er sengene svært gode! Vi trodde også det skulle være bad og to soverom tilgjengelig i kjelleren. Av diverse uheldige omstendigheter viste det seg å ikke være tilfelle. \nVerten er lett tilgjengelig  og var behjelpelig ma med å bestille catering til oss.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>5 stars only. Nothing bad to say about this apartment and the hosts were lovely and quick responding. The place is a seperate ground floor apartment of a house with private enterance.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location for us was perfect - I ran the Haga Park parkrun which was just 15 min walk away and my sister ran the 10k female only race - 35 min walk.  The local area was busy and had a supermarket (Co-op) 3 mins walk, coffee shops the same a bottle shop below the premises and restaurants.  Local buses, trams and trains a 5 min walk away.  The bus stop from Arlanda airport was 15mins walk but not too bad.  Gamla Stan was walkable and well worth it.  This was my 8th visit to Stockholm and it was mainly for the race my sister ran in  but the apartment was within walkable distance for the tourist areas of the city.  Will visit again for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ando was a responsive host to messages. My girlfriend and I had some troubles though. \n\nFirst, the check in time was “flexible”, so after we landed at Stockholm, I had not heard from Ando yet so I messaged him how to get into the apartment. He was at work and asked if we could come back after 17:00. We had all of our bags so that was not possible, so he asked if we could come to his work to get the keys. Fairly annoying with all of our bags but we said ok. Instructions on where he worked was not clear and he told us to “ask for directions from someone” because the name of the store was not coming up in (Hidden by Airbnb) maps.\n\nAfter, he text a place to meet instead and we got the keys and check in instructions from him.\n\nWe went to drop off our things (before the cleaning service had come) and the apartment was a mess! Underwear on the kitchen floor, trash all over, food scraps on the counter.\n\nWe left our bags and went to enjoy our day. When we came back (after the cleaning service had come and gone), there was still trash in the kitchen, in the living room, and the bed looked like the same sheets had been thrown on the bed again. \n\nWe found only one towel in the whole apartment (2 of us were staying), so we decided not to shower and just check out early the next day and shower at our next place. \n\nOverall the apartment was still pretty dirty and for the price, you would be better off booking a hotel or another Air B&B in another part of the city.\n\nHopefully ours was a sole bad experience, and other travelers have better luck.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Beautiful, clean, and quiet apartment in the center of the city. Walking distance from so many things (if you like to walk) but also close to T-Centralen if you prefer to take the train around. There’s a 24hr 7-Eleven near by in case of late-night “emergencies”.\n\nWe were 3 people (one slept on the large couch) and we absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend Alexandra’s apartment!\nDo note the building is on a hill but it’s not bad at all. :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>we had a short stay here. FYI: you pay about 6$/person for bed sheets. This place if fine if you’re on a budget, the room we were in had a lock and a window, 3 beds that were your standard ikea beds. During our stay there was one working bathroom that smelled quite bad and there was usually a line (there was other bathrooms but the women’s was out of order). It’s on the 7th or 8th floor of a building where the elevator wasn’t working (we didn’t mind walking up because we didn’t have big bags). The lady at the front desk was nice and gave me tips on where to go. Overall it’s cheap if that’s your criteria.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag fick en väldigt skön vistelse på stugan under en vecka med morgonyoga och frukost på altanen, beundra utsikten mot vattnet, lyssna på naturens ljud, promenera/jogga längs stigar i skogen, plocka hallon och blåbär, basta och bada, mysa framför öppen spis, etc. Niclas var väldigt hjälpsam värd. Enda problemet under min vistelse var att både dricksvattnet och vattnet i duschen tog slut ibland men det löste sig genom att jag köpte dricksvatten i flaska och badade i sjön om vattnet tog slut i duschen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is a very good place to stay, and the best host you can get.\nVery kind, helpful and makes you feel like its your own place. Its a stylish, clean and modern apartment. \nI have nothing bad to say.\nDef a place to stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin lägenhet med mycket bra läge! Nära vattnet, restauranger o parker. Rent o fräscht, nyrenoverat kök/badrum. Tvättmaskin o torktumlare i lägenheten. Lägenheten ligger på nedre botten, men ingen störande trafik.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fin lägenhet med plats för upp till 6 pers med alla bekvämligheter man kan behöva. Till Älvsjö station (pendeltågsstationen) tog det ca 10 min att gå, där gick sedan tåget till Stockholm C flera gånger i timmen, tog ca 12 min, vilket var mycket enkelt och smidigt för vår del. En livsmedelsbutik finns mkt nära, ca 50m att gå från lägenheten. I lägenheten finns allt för att fixa både frukost och middag, fina sängkläder och badhanddukar till alla. Ska vi upp till Stockholm igen så blir det att kolla om detta stället är ledigt i första hand :-)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Helt underbar, stilren (och ren) och trevlig lägenhet! Den är verkligen one of a kind men det gäller att en gillar trappor för det är flera trappor när en tar sig mellan våningarna. Sovrummet ligger längst ner sen är det tre trappsteg till köket och badrummet, sen en mycket brant trappa upp till köksbordet och ytterdörren och sen ytterligare några trappsteg upp till soffområdet. Men det är fantastiskt fin! Vi hade en mycket trevlig vistelse!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Amazing place and the error for the listing stating wrong bed size has been corrected, or at least I think it has. The listing said it was a king bed and it was a double. Paulina was able to give us a partial refund because of it. The home was very clean and really beautiful though and I enjoyed my stay. I would definitely stay here again if it was just me.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Snyggt och prydligt boende och riktigt bra läge. Skön golvvärme i badrummet. Hedvig snabb och proffsig i sin kommunikation. Det enda jag kunde önska är en bekvämare bäddsoffa annars ett toppenställe.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Min kollega jobbade i Farsta och jag bokade boendet åt henne, hon var mycket nöjd och rekomenderar detta starkt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Het is een ruime woning met 2 badlkamers, 3 toiletten, veel licht in huis en voldoende ruimte voor 7 mensen. Alles is er netjes en schoon. Fantastisch!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag har tillbringat två veckor i karantän på Niro och är mycket nöjd med bemötande och bekvämlighet. Tillgången till spis, mikro, diskmaskin, TV, bekväm säng och rymligt badrum har gjort vistelsen mycket angenäm och kan varmt rekommenderas.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This is one of those guest rooms that used to be a part of a larger flat and later got redecorated for letting out. So it is very small. It is in a good location, few stops away from Stockholm center and very close to cafes, shops and public transport. The flat was clean and the check-in was very easy.\n\nWhat I thought was the real bummer was the size of the shower, in which even a small person like me had difficulty moving around. Another important issue for me was the fact that there was only one wash basin/sink in the flat. So one has to use that for everything. The lack of rubbish bins meant that we also had to keep the rubbish bags sitting in the tiny hallway. My last comment is about the bed. The bed is a sofa bed which is rather uncomfortable and it is not big enough for two people, maybe and adult and child... This goes for the rest of the flat, too. \n\nGiven all this I thought the flat was more expensive that it should be. I probably would have thought that it was ok it didn’t cost what it did. Although we stayed at a reduced price, I would still say that it was bad value for the money we paid. Also, you have to strip your own bed, eventhough you are paying both a service fee and a cleaning fee.\nThere is nothing seriously wrong with the flat or the experience but many small annoyances...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfekt hus för två familjer. Härlig pool och bara några minuter ner till vattnet. Fina promenadvägar längs vattnet bort till ännu finare bad.\nKommunikationen har fungerat toppen, Charlotte ger snabba svar. Kommer gärna tillbaka!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag, min man och våra fyra tonårstjejer spenderade några härliga dagar i Charlottes lyxiga hus. Charlotte är en proffsig, mycket trevlig värd som är lätt att kommunicera med. Huset har alla tänkbara bekvämligheter, rent och snyggt med en välskött pool. Läget är mycket lugnt i ett vackert villaområde, det passade oss perfekt. Nära till badplats och springstråk med utegym för dem som gillar sånt. Jag kan varmt rekommendera detta boende. Hälsningar Camilla</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was clean, but a bad smell was coming out from the bathroom.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great room! Clean and warm. You don’t need the heating. The bed is not the most comfortable, as they are a bit too soft. But for a short stay, it is not too bad for your back. Good transport to the centre of Stockholm as there is a metro station nearby (2 min walk).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ett bra boende med närhet till tunnelbanan. Även nära till bad och sol under sommaren</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was clean, good size bedroom and with all the amenities you require. It is about 30 min from the Central Station (you need to change a train and a bus) so count on that but once you know where you are going, it isn't too bad. \nWe had a great stay and will stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tip top lejlighed med gode senge og dyner/ puder, super bad, køkken og tv/wi-fi. Nemt låsesystem og brandsikre døre. Alt i højeste hotelstandard. Nemt til Coop og Max- døgncafe. Alene p- afgift må påregnes, men sådan er det overalt i Stockholm.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This apartment is great. They also had a washer which was a plus. Nice and quiet community which I liked after the busy day. General store is just 2 mins walk away. \n\nI only didn’t like one thing and that is cleanliness. It wasn’t bad but it could be better. Also, the host mentioned that there would be a shampoo but there wasn’t any.... \n\nOverall, a v good experience and I would highly recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I really enjoyed calling this apartment home for a few weeks. Hedvig was very welcoming and accommodating. It’s small but cute apartment, great as a home-bade while visiting Stockholm. <5 minute walk to the blue line made getting around the city very easy, lots of restaurants and cafes close by, and a COOP on the corner for any other food needs. Thank you Hedvig!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>God beliggende lejlighed med store rummelige værelser. Dog er køkkenet og bad meget gammel og slidt hvilket får det til at fremstå beskidt.\nSuper beskrivelser fra værten i forhold til indtjekning og kommunikation i øvrigt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gode store soverum,meget lille køkken og dårlig aflukning med dør til bad og toilet.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Be noticed that this is super super small. Room is enough for the sofa bed and a small table. The bathroom is super super small, less than 1m2 with the basin hanging over the toilet. The bathroom smell is terrible, though we have tried to flush water and open the door as instructed. I even bought a spray to pretend it good. Kitchen is of course small too adn has no fan or ventilation, we dare not to cook anything. The sound proof is very bad, hearing the guy in the next apartment (originally in the same apartment) talking on the phone as he is in the middle of your airbnb. However, the location is good. And the host leave some good tea, coffee for you. Bedding linen and towels are clean.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is very good for one or two persons. Very clean and well maintained, checkin was very easy, good location and not so far from metro. The transportation nearby is tvarbanan and bus, but still very good. For me the bad thing was the chat with them was unresponsive, so I couldn’t ask for early checkin and other things. Oh, having a washing machine was a good touch!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great apartment in a great and central location in Stockholm. Many nice restaurants and bars just below. Quiet relative to its cental location. The apartment was very spacious and well equipped. The only bad thing was the cigarettes smell in the apartment, despite the clear 'No Smoking' sign on the wall.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A bit of false advertising. Completly different Apartment to the one we booked. At least what we thought we’d booked. First 20 out of the 22 pictures were of a totally different apartment. So we were a bit disappointed. The smell is really bad, tried spraying perfume around, making coffee, even tried not opening the windows when we cooked to make the smell go away. It is very distinct and not very pleasant. Other than that, the apartment was clean. We tried communicating for earlier check in and they replied to contact them on the day of arrival. We did but never received a reply back.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location is perfect and right in the center of old town (Gamla Stan). The apartment however had some clear oversights like cleanliness and dated fixtures/furnishings. Overall it’s not a bad property but you are paying for location. It’s not a bad apartment but for the price it’s certainly not worth what’s asked for.\n\nWe sent a note to inquire on drying rack availability for clothes and received no responses two weeks even before the stay. Unfortunate lack of host communication.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastisk kul leilighet med bra beliggenhet. Gode senger og herlig med to bad med hånklevarmer. Det var veldig lett å ta seg rundt, da t-bane var rett ved. Frokost spiste vi rett ved leiligheten, på et sted med nydelig mat og fantastisk kaffe! Kan absolutt anbefales! Vi var 6 stk, og det var ingen problem.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice apartment, not enough neat and clean\nRough and bad smelling towels</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Great location if you want to stay in Gamla Stan.  It's just a few minutes walk from everything you would want to see there.  The host was very understanding.  The apartment was small, but stylish and it has everything you need.  Bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  Check-in was easy with the door code.  I accidentally went to the wrong apartment (what they refer to as \"\"second floor\"\" here is actually \"\"third floor\"\" to an American!).  I actually knew this</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Positives:\n- Excellent location in Gamla Stan and very short walk to public transportation (bus, metro, ferry, Royal Palace)\n- very spacious and stylish with high ceilings and comfortable bed\n- clean\n- nice water pressure in shower\n\nAreas of Opportunity:\n- Host was slow to respond and not easily accessible. When asked if she could call me to get Netflix set up on the TV, she said no and that I would have to figure it out. But I don’t think Netflix was even available on their TV even though the listing stated it was. \n- Communication was not clear. I was provided conflicting codes to get into the building. I had to search for the Wi-fi password when I arrived as it was not listed on the welcome sheet on arrival and instructions stated they were in a hallway closet, but there was no hallway closet.\n- bad odor upon entering and leaving the building as you have to pass the garbage area to get to the room. The garbage is behind a closed door, but you can still smell it.\n- some noise due to location, but nothing ear plugs can’t solve \n\nOverall, we did have a nice stay. If you don’t have any issues during your stay, then the slow response time of host may not be an issue. But, if you do have an issue during your stay, then it may take a while to get resolved if ever. For me, accessibility of the host is very important, especially being in a foreign country. Thankfully, we did not face any major issues during our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The self check-in process could  definitely be improved: the door codes were out of date and we ended up in the wrong airbnb. Sofia was quick to respond to messages so we were able to stay in the alternative apartment but, as it was missing a washing machine, we had to use the one in the basement.\n\nThe apartment is located in the old town so fantastic for tourism, the downside being the bars on the ground floor which are quite loud at night for any light sleepers, especially with the window open.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location of the apartment is perfect. It’s just in the center of Gamla Stan and you can go everywhere walking.\nThe apartment is nice, the only thing was that they don’t include any service like (Gel, Shampoo, etc) and the Bathroom was smelling very bad.\nThe rest of the apartment is very nice and cozy.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>My first impression in the apartment was cozy, then I went crazy on seeing that he has plants. \n\nI felt so at home, that I forgot what had brought me to Stockholm. Honestly I did not want to leave the cosy soffa on my second day. The depature was even worse.\n\nYou have seen all the stars on cleanlyness etc my stars are also included on those counts.\n\nAbout the host personally. I felt lucky for the opportunity to get to share a roof with a dream man.\nDown to earth\nCalm and collected\nLoves plants\nNo house pets due my allegies\nClean home with absolutely No clutters -yes!\nLooks gorgeous even in lounge wear\nThe typ of human being that you’ll Will enjoy their presence even when they are on silence mode.\n\nAbsolutely to recommend! ❤️❤️❤️</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice, airy apartment right next to the AlbaNova university in a college-like development.  Clean, simple furnishings (comfortable beds), with nearby grocery store.  It's about a 40 minute walk to the major sightseeing areas on pleasant streets; the bus is nearby, but you need to transfer or walk 15 minutes to the subway. Again, it's not a bad walk, but you might want to know this. Anna was a friendly host.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We enjoyed our stay all in perfect style and conditions. But a small table inside to sit for breakfast, would have been appreciated. The space by the entrance fits just fine. Well we did Mr.Cake every day which was not bad at all. \nAll in all a great stay  a beautiful place and perfect neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Christopher är en trevlig prick med en gullig dotter. Rummet ligger innanför köket och är spartanskt inrett men det fungerade för mig. Man får lite plats i kyl och frys, och kan laga mat i köket.\nJag gick tidigt, oftast därifrån innan sju, så vi sågs inte på morgonen. Christopher fixade garageplats i huset, vilket jag utnyttjade till att åka in till min lägenhet på Söder som är under renovering på kvällarna.\nKom därför ofta ganska sent. De gånger jag var där tidigt, dök Christopher inte upp förrän 8-9 tiden på kvällarna. Det finns en separat toalett för gäster, men man kan ta en dusch i badrummet på morgonen.\nRekommenderas varmt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wanneer je één kamer huurt is het niet geschikt voor twee personen. Je kunt niet om het bed heen lopen, dus moet je over elkaar heen kruipen.\nGeen balkon.\nHet is een mooi appartement, smaakvol ingericht.\nDe badkamer is schoon en ruim. \nCharlotte is een vriendelijke gastvrouw en hulpvaardig.\nLet op: geen gratis parkeren, betaald parkeren aan de straat.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Så snyggt, stiligt och smidigt! Läget var lugnt och skönt och vi sov så gott i sängen. Att kunna ta ett varmt bad kändes extra lyxigt och allt var fräscht och flöt på så felfritt. Inga invändningar, utan återvänder gärna till denna mysiga plats!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hade en fantastisk vistelse i Ylva och Nicklas lägenhet. Så fort jag öppnade dörren möttes jag av doften av nyskurat och en stor yta med alla tänkbara bekvämligheter du kan tänka dig. Sängen var också väldigt skön. Jag hade lite frågor till värdarna då jag bland annat behövde handla och jobba hemma. De svarade mycket snabbt och var väldigt snälla och hjälpsamma. Hur gulligt som helst var också att de bar ut en stol och bord och filt så jag skulle kunna sitta ute och jobba.\n\nJag gillade även närheten till stan, den mysiga lilla badsjön och parken några 100 meter bort. \n\nSammanfattningsvis hade jag en mycket angenäm vistelse hos Ylva och Nicklas och tackar för överraskningspresenten också.\nKan rekommendera en vistelse här.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>August’s place is special- we didn’t want to leave it. It’s bigger than it looks from the photos and every detail was thought of. It’s one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on and the whole space is so chic. August replied fast, was super friendly, and checked in on us. You can’t go wrong with this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Clean, bright, and in a fun area! The food here was awesome and we felt very safe. Lots of places to eat and drink, and lots of playgrounds for kids too. It is a walk to a metro, and make sure you buy your bus pass at the station bc they don’t take cash!! The host was quick to respond and check in was quick and easy. The bathroom floors are heated too which feels extra fancy. We had bad luck with the elevator in the building though...</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You book a huge and spacious apartment in the heart of Gamla Stan. We really liked it, the interior and the old building is charming. You can’t go wrong with it for a few nice days in Stockholm. Very clean!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Comfortable and stylish place in a quiet neighborhood. Not too bad of a walk to all of the sights  and is also well connected with the subway and public transit. Good shops nearby and great communication with host!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lejlighed ligger i et dejligt område\nMasser af butikker og cafeer \nEbba er sød og imødekomme \nDog så kunne rengøring være bedre \nIsær i badeværelse</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Super fin och fräsch lägenhet, bra städat och sköna sängar. Smidig incheckning med portkod och nyckelbox.\nHade gärna önskat mer husgeråd så som fler bestick och vinglas. Ingen Micro, vad vi kunde hitta iallafall. \nEnbart en liten duschvägg vilket gjorde hela badrummet blött när man duschade.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Hands-off for your own good! \nAlthough I can say it was one of my worst experiences on Airbnb, I try to stay fair for the review, so I start with the positives: \n- The apartment is very clean and the photos are showing exactly how the flat looks like.\n- The location is very good and you can reach the city center in 15 minutes and the old Center. (Gamla stan) in 30 min on foot. \n- Elias is very nice. He did his best to communicate and solve the problems and offered a 30% refund on the payment (excl. cleaning and service fee) \n- There are plenty of restaurants and bars near the building \n\nNegatives:\n- The location is quiet. However the building and neighbors are very noisy. There are lots of noises (even during nights around 2:00 or 3:00) and also construction noises from outside and inside the building. They start from 6:00 in the morning and continue the whole day. We couldn’t sleep at all during the weekdays. I told Elias about it, he tried to talk with the landlord but nothing changed afterwards, he also denied a full refund on the first days, only when just three days were left and after tons of chats with airbnb support he offered it, which made no sense for us at that time. \n- There are not enough bedsheets for 4 people staying. So remember to keep some with you if you are in a bigger group!\n- The internet is not working properly and it is very slow. We faced lots of disconnections and most of the times we were on our cellphone networks.\n- The lift in the house very small (and old). It was stuck 3 or 4 times between the floors during our stay. We saw an old lady stuck inside. So better keep the stairs.\n- There is absolutely no cheap parking places near the building. You can park in front of the building for almost 22 Euros/day. ( it is forbidden on Fridays from 00:00 to 8:00, which were nice to be mentioned by the host in order to prevent a 110 Euro ticket.all the signs are in swedish, I would expect more info from the host) \n- If you are traveling by car with a non swedish plate, be careful, the police ( or the company for parking) are looking for such cars as victims! Even when you pay with the app, put a paper behind your window. I got another 90 Euro ticket with the reason that there was no proof of payment in the car. Asked the locals, it is possible to cancel the wrong ticket but good luck with the bureaucracy.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Fantastiskt ställe som ligger precis nere vid vattnet! Vi hade en härlig helg med  bad i jacuzzin och fin solnedgång. Huset var skinande rent när vi kom.\n\nInstruktionerna för att ta sig till huset var tydliga och fungerade väl. Andreas är en bra värd som svarade supersnabbt om man hade frågor. Vi hade en mycket trevlig upplevelse och lär återkomma!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi hade en fantastisk helg på detta smultronställe. Perfekt hus för sol, bad och middagar med ett större sällskap. Vi kommer definitivt hyra det igen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi har haft två kanondagar i huset, med magiskt fint väder, bad och frukost vid vattnet. Läget är toppen!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The “Cave” is awesome, located near the center, in hipster area with top restaurants and design shops. Metro station 7 minutes walk. Apartment is small but very convenient for 2 people. With stylish interior in the best Swedish traditions. Especially with second floor bad and hammock in the apartment. Petra is very hospitable, quick answering with best recommendations. Recycle practices in Stockholm are great, you can get payback for plastic bottles and cans near the apartment in Coop supermarket. Highly recommended, enjoy!)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Anja's apartment is perfectly located. Using public transport you reach it from the airport quite easily and going into town you can take Bus no. 50 or Tunnel Bana. \nThe reception was extraordinary friendly, communication easy and quick.\nThe apartment is cosy and well equipped. Although we couldn't use the balcony due to bad weather we really enjoyed staying there.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is bigger than it looks and is very well located which is both good and bad because it gets very noisy especially with the bars directly down the street. We had issues with the check-in like previous guests. We had a hard time contacting the host and had to wait for almost an hour outside the apartment. There was zero communication during the stay, I sent a few messages asking questions and never got a response. But after checkout, I guess we missed cleaning a few spots in the house - our bad - the host was very quick to message us about it which we found odd. Anyways, if you’re going in the summer, bring eye covers because there are no blinds and we had to sleep with the sun.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>This apartment wasn't available, so we were promised another, much fancier apartment for the same price. One hour before check in, we were moved again, to a much worse place than the one advertised in this advert. Note that this was not via Airbnb, but via a number the host gave me, who took over all correspondence.\nThe apartment we ultimately got was really bad and creepy, so we left and Airbnb cancelled the booking. I don't even know why i can leave a review, we where never here. Still, don't book with this company.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Et perfekt sted for et besøk i Stockholm. Metro rett ved noe som gjorde det enkelt å dra inn til byen. Leiligheten var delikat og smart innredet med et flott kjøkken og spiseplass, stort og fint bad. Perfekt med parkering utenfor for oss som hadde med bil. \n\nVi fikk kjapp tilbakemelding ved bestilling og ryddig og fine beskrivelser ved ankomst. \n\nEn av de bedre opplevelser ved AirBnB! \n\nTakk for oss!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We felt very comfortable in the small apartment.  There is everything necessary.  The location is just great in the beautiful old town.  Too bad that you can only open a window, so a bit dark.  We were promised a queen bed 1.5x2m, but the bed is only 1.20 meters wide.  Pity!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Appartment is at a perfect location close to everything in Stockholm city.\nHost had a great communication and the check in was easy.\nThe appartment itself was quite a disappointment. It’s located next to restaurants and all the noices from the patio came as loud as they would have been inside the appartment. The outer door was a simple old wooden door with only drapes as a cover inside. Would say it was far from a comfy and safe feeling stay. For a business trip a bad choise if you need a peaceful good nights sleep.\nIn the bathroom you could see silver fishes moving when turning the light on. Wouldn’t say that gave any bether feeling of the place. Shame as hosts and location is perfect, but the appartment a disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment location and its decoration was really good, but we have some problems that weren't solved. Light switches were not working or with bad maintenance. We were the whole week without light in the bathroom.\nThe shower had a big crack which leaked a lot of water.\nThere were no cutlery available.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfekt centralt läge i Gamla stan. Boendet består i ett rum i en större lägenhet. Bekväm säng annars en byrå och liten stol. Tillgång till toalett, badrum och kök. Värden är mycket välkomnande och vänlig på alla sätt. Perfekt som övernattning centralt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Omar sent us a payment request for $200 after our booking was confirmed. Didn’t give us any reasoning behind it. When we messaged him about it, he asked us to cancel the reservation because he was unable to have guests. Later he changed his story to tell us he had a friend pass. Although I would understand why he would want to cancel, he refused to cancel the reservation on his end or provide a proper explanation. Why would charge us the additional fee to begin with? \n\nWe contacted Airbnb support to aid us with the situation and they refunded us our money and warned us about scams like the one Omar is running. The entire situation was very fishy. \n\nBe careful with this host and avoid if possible. Left a very bad impression and goes completely against all Airbnb community guidelines. Felt like a scam through the whole process which is sad because we’ve been using Airbnb with great hosts for many years.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Perfect in everythin! I cannot say anything wrong. Sanna thanks a lot!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We bad a great time in Ivars apartment and loved the area around it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Väldigt bra läge på lägenheten. Nära till både tunnelbana och mataffär. Lätt att hitta ifrån själva tunnelbanan och en väldigt bra kommunikation ifrån värden. Vardagsrummet och köket var väldigt rymligt och stora. Ett minus var att badrummet var väldigt litet och man fick knappt plats att duscha då duschen nästan låg \"\"ovanför\"\" toaletten. Då vi var tre tjejer som delade på lägenheten hade det varit bra med en spegel i vardagsrummet. En annan sak var att det var extremt lyhört och vi stördes väldigt mycket av grannarna som hade ett skrikande barn hela nätterna. Lägenheten låg även på fjärde våningen och det fanns tyvärr ingen hiss.  Svårt att bära upp tungt bagage uppför så många trappor. Slutligen så var det väldigt mycket damm i vardagsrummet och vi hade önskat bättre städning. Då jag har astma så blev det lite jobbigt att sova. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was our first experience with Airbnb as guests and we could not ask  for better, Caroline and Rutger are wonderful hosts!\nAt our arrival we could not find the way and Rutger came to meet us with a big smile, thank you again! (for future guests: we took the wrong exit of the metro but it’s very simple, just take the exit named “Johanneshovsvägen” after the first escalators on the right and you will reach the building in 3-minute walk).\nThe apartment is as beautiful as in the pictures, cosy and very sunny. There is a fully equipped kitchen and the space is well organized, perfect for a single or a couple. \nMetro, supermarkets and shops are very close and from the metro of Gullmarsplan, in few stops you can directly reach the heart of the city. \nStockholm is just amazing!!! All green lovers will fall in love with this city!\nI am sorry I could not meet Caroline personally but the communication with her worked great. She is a very kind and helpful person, talking with her by Airbnb was a truly pleasure.\nI warmly recommend this place to anyone, we felt like at home.\n\nThank you again for everything Caroline and Rutger, we hope to meet you again in the future.\n\nAll the best,\nNadia & Domenico</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Vi bodde hos Lina i 3 veckor. Stort rum med alla bekvämligheter, vi delade köket och badrummet med ägaren. Lugnt område. Väldigt bra kommunikation med Lina hela tiden. Huset är jättetrevligt och mysigt. Små detaljer som visade omtänksamhet och som gjorde vår vistelse väldigt trevlig.\nSkulle absolut rekommendera Linas rum till andra resenärer/besökare.\nTack igen Lina!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>> Stay away, get a hotel - Don't think twice !\nIf you can avoid staying in shady places like this it would be best. \n\nMy experience was very bad at Olof's place,\n\nI was expecting a vintage style room / apartment unfortunately the listing was not as good as perfectly posted. The are no real bed, just a couch. The bathroom is tiny and measures exactly 1 square meter. It's impossible to shave nor do anything due to the small size of the sync. The wooden floor cracks on every step you take. Opening the curtains in this room was a gymnastic accomplishment. The curtain bar was unstable, which makes an opening (and closing) the curtains a hassle. My room was on the third floor with no lift nor elevator.\n\n I had to carry my pieces of luggage all the way up and down when checking out. The worst part is that the apartment is on a busy street, The place is very noisy, church bells won't let you sleep at all, truck and drunk people walking on the streets at night neither. It's ironic how strict the host was in his description about guest not making noise from 22:00 until 8:00 yet forgot to mention that you will never sleep at night. \n\nI arrived at the address at night, the keys were easy to find however I had two luggages with me and there was no lift nor elevator to get me on the third floor. When I got there I realise the place is very small.\n\nGreat location (in the middle of Stockholm) yet accessible by car. Uber won't pick you up there. Host failed to mention that the road in the whole area is made from bricks which makes it impossible to roll your pieces of luggage. In my case two of them. \n\nI quickly changed my dates to get a hotel in the city center. \nI should have done that at the first place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>En central pärla i Stockholm. Snabb och god kommunikation med Ulrika. Nära till allt. Bekväm säng och rymligt badrum. Enkelt att finna parkering utanför ;-)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location: The apartment is close to the train/metro station. But worry not. Swedish trains are extremely quiet. In general, the whole neighbourhood is nice and quiet. There is a supermarket (2 mins of walking from the place) opened 7-23, a couple of restaurants and a very nice nature in a walkable distance.\nApartment: Very clean, cosy and modern looking! I have no bad experience to share. The apartment we had was simply in a top-notch condition with everything you need for small cooking, relaxing etc.\nHost: Very professional, kind and swift communication. I've decided to do check-in / out without any personal assistance/guidance, Louise provided me with very detailed instructions to follow. Everything was smooth and I can only hope that every Airbnb host will be like Louise. Thank you! :)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Biggest issue with this apartment was that the windows are old and are leaking in air from outside to the point where you can feel a breeze while sitting in the couch. One day it was snowing and we had snow flying into the apartment via holes in the window pane. This is the case for multiple windows in the apartment which creates constant airflow in the apartment. Not great. Secondly, the host did not seem very willing to help with requests since it took nearly 2 weeks to receive a coffee pot that was missing. Replaced coffee pot was the wrong brand and didn't work.  Other than this, the apartment is newly renovated and floor heating in bathroom which was a big plus.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Easy stay. Quick response. Nothing bad about this place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, rooms are very clean but there was a very bad smell in the bathroom for our whole stay.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Generator is the only place to stay in Stockholm. It’s extremely clean, has very good front desk and cafe service, the breakfast is good and worth the price. It’s located in a really convenient area for the price. I only had one issue when they gave me the wrong ticket when trying to buy one for the Arlanda Express, but they refunded me the ticket when I emailed them about the mistake! Lovely people, lovely place.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Super clean bad and toilet. Shared rooms but instead of 6 people we had only 3 and everyone was safe according to COVID-19 instructions. Super clean installation. Good location close of metro/train and walking around is really good.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Generator was located in a great part of the city! I should have read the details better because I was expecting to be able to cook but there’s no kitchen available so you have to pay for food there or out and about. This feels more like a party than I thought, which isn’t a bad thing just wasn’t what I was looking for. All that aside it was comfortable, clean and the staff were all super friendly and helpful!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place is good place sleep or hang with your friends, one bad ones is the food I order the chicken burger ther and that was not the best one... Take something different then me, hopp that's one is better.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>andreas appartment is nice - pretty big kitchen and the living room area is comfortable. bedroom is very small but cozy and i didnt find it to be a problem.  theres a supermarket very close by which is useful, underground station is a bit of a walk but not too bad. rooftop terrace not much fun in winter but an amazing view</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sehr schönes Apartement und sehr geräumig.\nLeider ist das große Zimmer ein durchgangszimmer und im kleinen Kinderzimmer ist ein fenster das direkt ins bad rein zeigt.\nDie badewanne ist leider kaputt, aber es gibt ein zweites Bad mit dusche, das allerdings sehr klein ist aber sauber und schön. Generell liegen sehr viele private Sachen in der Wohnung herum, teilweise unverstaut.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything went well. Aaron is really a unique and lovely person, best host ever! The apartment was really clean and near to the center. Only hic is that we had a one place bed for 2 people so I slept really badly. \nBut If there was another bed or more mattress, I would definitively come back.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very kind hosts, the place is clean and cozy, close to the subway station. Not a single bad word can be said, heartily recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Meryem was a great host, gave quick responses and welcomed us nicely to her place. Her apartment was clean, tidy and full of comfort. The apartment is in a quiet and clean neighborhood, like 20 min to city center by underground/metro which is not bad at all.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place was spotless, in a friendly neighboorhood with variations of good take away close by. The metro is also very close so it’s easy to get around. Oskar is very friendly and answered quickly to solve whatever the issue. We had some problems finding the key because we had the wrong code, however the issue was solved immediately as Oskar was available. He even let us have the apartment a bit longer on Sunday. Highly recommendable for 2 people going to Stockholm, good value, clean and nice apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I totally recomend this Airbnb! Super! It's everything perfect! We definitely will come back! Thank you for everything!\nPd: ask and check the adress because (Hidden by Airbnb) maps took us to the wrong location!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I just want to get a place to sleep, and Victoria's place failed to meet my need. 1) she hosted a small party but it was surprisingly very loud at late night with screaming and loud TV, even I told them I'm sleeping early to catch early flight 2) I love dogs. However, Victoria's dog bark CONSTANTLY, I was waken up multiple times in 2/3 am by the dog, and also for whatever reason with loud noises of cooking pots etc banging in the kitchen (right next to my room). This is probably my only bad review in my past dozens of stays with airbnb, but I'm sorry I really had a very miserable sleepless night at this place.\n\nAdditionally, for whatever reason the airbnb listing doesn't have the detailed address except the street name. I told the host in advance that I'm arriving in the evening. Close to my arrival time, I first texted AND called Victoria about the detailed address, she said she will replied me over the message. An hour later, I never get the message. I had to call AND text again, and in the end she just told me on the phone, and even she claimed she sent me multiple messages, I never get one. (maybe the airbnb support can double check and confirm here)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a fantastic start of a beautiful trip through the south of Sweden in Johan’s great place. He was very kind and attentive! Too bad for me, that he was already booked out on my way back. I would have enjoyed to stay again at his place!!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I did not enjoy my stay at Charlie's. Before I arrived, he gave me detailed instructions on how to avoid his neighbors because apparently they are upset with him for AirBnBing his apartment due to some bad experiences in the past; he asked me to lie to them if I met them in the hallway.\n\nThere was a security camera INSIDE the apartment - apparently also because of bad guests in the past - which he assure me was for my own safety. The apartment itself was sterile and soulless: clearly nobody has ever lived in it and it is being run as a hotel business.\n\nFinally, after my stay, Charlie kept pestering me on (Hidden by Airbnb) , trying to extort a a 5-star review--if I gave him 5 stars, he would give me 5 stars in return, he said. I ignored him.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Don't have too high expectations on this appartement, it's older  and not as nice as the pictures show. \n-The bathroom was not properly clean (curtain and corners of the shower orange and black of bacterias + crawling insect !)\n- It smelt bad in the appartement when we arrived and when I told Tony he said that we could open the window, what we already did, but this should have been done before\n- There were big traces of burnt in the wall in front of the bed\n- There was no light working in the kitchen except the one in the oven\n- There was barely no soap in the bathroom\nTony told me about the two last points before our arrival, but the accumulation of all these previous points made our stay less enjoyable.\nAside from the fact that when I reported all these points to Tony he told me that I could leave the appartement and find something else if I wasn't satisfied, I guess he is a lovely guest.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jättefin lägenhet med harmoni och sobert inredd i vackra färger och fint ljus med utsikt över lummig grönska.

Tack Hedvig och Sandra för snabba svar och omtanke om sina gäster</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The location was great, accessible to anywhere by metro or even walking and not so loud at night even at the new year’s season. However, checking in was not easy. I was given this number to contact a guy who is living in the apartment right after made a reservation, and I did through (Hidden by Airbnb) , he replied “okay im waiting for you!”. It was all good until the check in day. I messaged the guy that we are coming at the night twice or three times both in the morning and after when we got in to stockholm, but no response. Already at night, we arrived at the place and called this number several times, still unreachable. About an half hour later he finally responded “who is this?” I had to explain that I booked the room on this day and he said that he forgot that we were coming. The address that is given on here was wrong but walk another 3mins, and we finally got to the apartment. The guy did not expect that we were coming on that night so the room was uncleaned, but he changed the sheets immediately for us. Maybe if I should’ve contacted him much earlier that we are coming on this day, all of this could not have happened.\n\nThe instructions were quite easy and basic nothing special to be careful. Bathroom was spacious and looked nice but there’s no bath mat, and toilet paper was always running out, maybe better buy some. And guests should bring slippers too, the floor is not really clean even you have to take your shoes off.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the stay in Stockholm with great location, (Hidden by Airbnb) respect their privacy too. Kitchen was spacious and clean so we liked cooking there.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"My stay at Second Home was for 28 days, so this should be a more thorough review than someone staying for a weekend.\n\nThe double studio apartment itself is very nice. Location is excellent and self-serve check-in is convenient. Keycodes for everything and that means no worrying about keys or keycards. I didn't mind the stairs, but if you are not very physical, then you might struggle hauling your luggage - there is no help available or lift.\n\nApartment is modern and clean. High ceilings as well, which is unusual for the area, and even though my window faced out onto the courtyard/faced the Hilton, it let in a good amount of light (or as much as exists in Sweden during November)...\n\nBed was comfortable, but if you don't like a firmer mattress, or are heavier person, you might find it uncomfortable. Nice and clever separation between bedroom, living space, bathroom and kitchen makes the apartment feel bigger than what it is and like you are in an apartment and not a hotel room.\n\nThe kitchen is reasonable only because there is no oven. This was annoying as I cook a lot of meat, so instead had to get into blanching, which was fine to put up with the for month's stay. Also no colander/sieve, which is ridiculous considering you only have a hob for cooking. That means boiling everything and then draining it. I had to go out and buy one.\n\nKitchen is a bit cramped juggling cooking and cleaning dishes using the supplied collapsible drainer and is really only suitable for one person and not two. Fridge works well and is spacious. Microwave is modern and works well. The extractor fan is powerful, but not obvious how to use - you need to grab the outside edge and pull it towards you. It's a smart and compact design.\n\nShower room is nice. There is underfloor heating and it's always very warm. Hot water never an issue. Good pressure. Includes hairdryer for those who need it, plus towels and basic toiletries.\n\nApartment itself, despite minus temperatures on some nights, was always warm. I worked from my apartment most days and I was never close to shivering. It was cosy.\n\nAlso, excellent storage in each room, from bedroom, to living space, bathroom and kitchen.\n\nAll in, sounds great? Not really, because now onto the bad, which is enough for me to NOT recommend Second Home Apartments, at least for a long stay. The problem is the NOISE from other rooms.\n\nI had students/weird young men in the room next to me. They had a sound system with them that would pump out THUMPING  bass. I am not that old, so appreciate modern music, but all I could hear was the thumping bass and nothing else. It was infuriating and at first went on until (Email hidden by Airbnb) plaining to Second Home seemed to prevent the twilight hour bass sessions, but it still continued during the day, with the \"\"gangstas\"\" piling into their room for shouty get togethers most evenings.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>En stor och trevlig lägenhet, sval på sommaren och med bra läge. Bra kommunikationer och lätt att ta sig till centrum med buss, nära till affär, mat och badställen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>MYCKET trevlig lägenhet och värd! Toppenbra! Läget är perfekt till Kristinebergsklipporna för sol och bad, samt nära till stan med tunnelbanan bara runt hörnet. Otroligt fin lägenhet med fräscha möbler. \n\nNågot man dock hade önskat är bättre ljus i badrummet alternativt att man som gäst tar med sig en egen spegel och sätter i fönstret för de som gillar att sminka sig och göra sig i ordning framför ljus :)  Annars var allt jättebra. Tack!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Trevligt rum med mycket ljus trots inget fönster. Stort badrum och ett praktiskt litet kök med mikro och diskmaskin samt köksredskap. Rekommenderar :)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Girish is a very hospitable person. We didn't get home until 12 pm because we got on the wrong bus that day. He waited us until we got home.We really appreciate him. He also prepared snacks and fruits for us. His flat is not far from the city center. It's very convenient to take the metro. The room is very cozy and tidy. \nIn a word, although it rained in Sweden these three days, meeting Girish and his Dutch friends really made up for the regret brought by the weather. We're very happy and grateful to meet Girish and Stephanie. I highly recommend Girish's flat!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>1 day before my trip host gave me wrong address (2,5 hours from city by bus), so I booked another hotel because host answered me late and said that’s a mistake (then host give me right address). That’s why I have to pay for this apartments, but I didn’t stay here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jag som var i Stockholm och jobbade behövde bara ett ställe för att sova, duscha och äta. Detta lilla stället passade mig perfekt. Enkel in och ut checkning, snabba svar vid frågor och T-banan rakt över gatan.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Op zich prima appartement. Alles wat je nodig hebt is er, maar je gaat wel back to basic. De badkamer is erg klein, een douchekop boven het toilet, en na het douchen moesten we de entree dweilen omdat alle water over de drempel was gestroomd.\nSchoon appartement, lekkere bedden. In een rustige wijk, op loopafstand van gamla stan en centraal station.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Bra läge, litet badrum och kök men det nämns tydligt i beskrivingen.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Otroligt litet badrum annars en toppen lägenhet med bra läge</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location, clean and we received clear instructions for check-in/out. However there was a constant bad smell coming from the bathroom that did not go away no matter what we did.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really bad communication and no way to check out later. Tiny shower by the toilet. Wifi sucked. But good location, comfy bed, tidy and clean.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great location with a beautiful balcony. The church lights up nicely in the evening/night and communication with Hedvig was fast and super clear. Experienced hosts, you can go wrong here. Everything was a pleasure!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location neat by the metro and bus station. So it’s convenient to reach the place you want to go. Not a bad choice for short term stay.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>It was the best stay ever! \nThe apartment is small and very bright. We stayed there for one week and understood that we could stay there for much longer if we could! \nWe had doubts in the beginning like that could be to far from the City Centre but we were totally wrong! It is 30 minutes away from the Centre and the public transport is perfectly scheduled so you can get to the Centre smooth and fast! \nAnd must admit that it is the best place for relaxing! if you have some busy day in the city, exploring museums and pretty old streets - you come back to the apartment and just relaxing!...) The most beautiful thing is the neighbourhood it is located.... There are several parks where you can have a wonderful stroll and even see some wild animals, it is always fresh and you will never feel tired there! There is a great lake near to the house. The place is very tranquil!\nThe apartment is perfectly equipped so you will never feel of any need like searching for laundry or a restaurant.. Since here you will get a washing machine and a wonderful little kitchen!\nThere are two transport nodes in a neighbourhood, where you can get to the subway or commuter train. Each has at least 1-2 supermarkets with quite nice prices and a huge choice of different products so which one to choose is up to you. There is also an ICA supermarket in 15 minutes walking.\nThere is a bus stop in 2 minutes walking from the house with the bus which goes with around 15 minutes delay. Using an SL app and an access card you can make your trips to any point in Stockholm fast, smooth and comfy!\n\nThere is absolutely nothing to complaint about, we totally loved our stay and we will definitely to go back there when we will go another time to Stockholm!\n\nRespect to Malin and Michael! You are the best!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Anna var lätt att kommunicera med och svarade snabbt. Lägenheten var inte städat när vi kom så det var en besvikelse men värden bad om ursäkt och vi löste det snabbt.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The owner gave us the wrong name of the apartment, and we cannot find the key(the institution is unclear), after got the key we can’t open the door. And we waited too long for the owner to open the door. Management is really bad</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place is exactly as described and the location can't be beat in my opinion. It was perfect for my purpose (business trip) as the place had a good bed, a functioning working table and very fast wifi. The place is clean and has all necessary amenities in terms of towels and soap, basic kitchen utensils, etc. Instructions during booking, check-in and check-out were automated but clear and accurate. I might not have rated my stay as highly if I were a tourist, as it lacks the personal touches and recommendations typical of a stay with a local host. This is clearly a business and seems to be operating most of the apartments in the same building. However, if a functioning, no-nonsense bedsit in an outstanding area is what you're looking for you can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Comfortable beds, nice location if you don’t arrive by car since the parking there is crazy expensive!\nThere was no soap to wash your hands and the apartment smelled really bad from cigarettes. We won’t rent this place again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Helt okej boende. På plussidan tyst i lägenheten och nära till lekplats, tunnelbana och centrum. Välutrustat kök och fräscht badrum. På minussidan inte så ombonat, och med en rätt obekväm sovsoffa. Sängen var däremot väldigt skön, men dörren till sovrummet går inte att stänga ordentligt. Prisvärt boende och trevlig och hjälpsam värd.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Härligt ställe att hänga på en varm sommarkväll! Vi yogade, badade, grillade och åt middag i lusthuset  med havet precis bredvid.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great place right in the centre of Gamla Stan (Old Town). Really fast and helpful communication by the team. Check in is very easy with a lockbox and the place was very stylish and cosy. \n\nThe only improvements we had were that there are not that many cooking utensils (no wooden spoon etc but very easy to overcome with other cutlery) and the hot and cold taps in the shower are labelled wrong ! Not big issues at all and certainly still value for money.\n\nWe had a wonderful stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Detta var vår första upplevelse av airbnb konceptet och jag är väldigt positivt överraskad. Vi möttes av en väldigt trevlig värdinna, Helen och ett mysigt nyrenoverat hus med otroligt fin utsikt över Mälaren och alla bekvämligheter man kan tänkas behöva, och saknades något så var Helene snabb med att tillgodose det. Bryggan, badtunnan och den underbara delikatessbutiken garpes bara några minuter från huset gjorde verkligen denna vistelse till en 5 plus. Kan varmt rekommendera detta boende.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Peter is an amazing host, we met for the check-in and he made sure everything was ready and available for a long stay. \nThe apartment is exactly as the photos sugest, very clean and modern. It is located very close to the Kista galleria shopping center and the metro station. \nNothing went wrong and I highly recomend it for long stays.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>An all round fantastic experience, great location for combining easy access to the city and rural areas in Stockholm. We particularly enjoyed going to Flatenbadet and Tyresta National Park. Hosts were really helpful and excellent communication from start to finish. Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rummet ligger i ett spännande ställe, är mysigt och bra för en eller två nätter. Interiören  var vacker, speciellt med små ljus. Handfat, både i rummet och i badrummet är jättesmå men annars allt är modernt och rent. Rekommenderat!</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\n\nselect amenities, splitted, exploded\nfrom (select amenities, split(amenities, \",\") as
